# Bridge — The Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry

The deductive chain goes downward from P² = P. But what forces
P² = P in the first place? The spec's answer: closure forces a
complemented modular lattice of partial views, and the fundamental
theorem of projective geometry (FTPG) shows this must be the
subspace lattice of a vector space over a division ring.

FTPG is a major theorem. Mathlib does not have it. We state it
as the ONE axiom in the formalization, clearly marked.

The axiom is bounded on both sides by proven theorems:
- Below: the capstone (Ground.lean) proves Sub(K, V) → FoamGround
- Here: uniqueness proves the representation is dimension-unique

The uniqueness theorem uses Mathlib's `Module.length_eq_finrank`:
the Krull dimension of the submodule lattice equals the vector
space dimension. Since Krull dimension is a lattice invariant,
a lattice isomorphism preserves dimension. The axiom can only
be satisfied in one way.

## Part I: The axiom

The fundamental theorem of projective geometry: a complemented
modular lattice satisfying irreducibility and sufficient height
is isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of a vector space
over a division ring.

We state this for lattices that are order-isomorphic to some
Sub(D, V). The full FTPG would derive the division ring and
vector space from the lattice alone.

/-- **The Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry (existence).**

    A complemented modular lattice of sufficient structure is
    isomorphic to the subspace lattice of a vector space over
    a division ring.

    This is the one axiom in the formalization. Everything else
    is a theorem. It is the bridge between the spec's derivation
    (closure → lattice properties) and the deductive chain
    (P² = P → everything).

    The full theorem would construct D and V from the lattice.
    We state the conclusion: an order isomorphism exists. -/

## Part II: Uniqueness — the lattice determines the dimension

The Krull dimension of the submodule lattice equals the vector
space dimension (for finite-dimensional spaces over division rings).
Since Krull dimension is a lattice invariant (preserved by order
isomorphisms), the axiom can only be satisfied by one dimension.

This is the mechanical bone next to the axiom: we can't prove
the bridge exists (that's the axiom), but we CAN prove that if
it exists, it lands in a unique place.

/-- **Uniqueness.** If two finite-dimensional vector spaces over the
    same division ring have order-isomorphic submodule lattices,
    they have the same dimension.

    Combined with the FTPG axiom: the lattice determines not just
    THAT a vector space representation exists, but WHICH dimension
    it must have. The axiom has exactly one solution (up to iso). -/

## What this establishes

**One axiom. Bounded by theorems. No orphans.**

The axiom (ftpg) states: a complemented modular lattice with
sufficient structure is isomorphic to a subspace lattice.

The uniqueness theorem (dimension_unique) proves: the dimension
of the target vector space is determined by the lattice. If the
axiom is satisfied, it's satisfied in essentially one way.

The capstone (Ground.lean: subspaceFoamGround) proves: the
subspace lattice satisfies FoamGround properties.

Together:
  FoamGround lattice →[axiom] Sub(D, V) →[unique] dimension fixed
  Sub(D, V) →[capstone] FoamGround ✓  (the loop closes)
  Sub(D, V) →[P²=P] deductive chain →[theorems] everything

The deductive chain is now one connected story from closure
to the last theorem, with exactly one axiom marking the one
place where citation replaces proof.
