# PersistenceLfp — carrier (b): §III's lfp as the scope-dependent persistence-flag

## What this file lands

`StatelessSubstrate.lean` left `P : Persistence` (`Scope → TapePosition → Prop`)
a free parameter and named two held-open carriers for *who supplies it*:

* **carrier (a)** — the operator's `HolonomicLedger` (a read-face persists iff it
  backs an undischarged debt). Landed in `StatelessSubstrate.lean` as
  `LedgerPersistence.flag`. **Scope-*independent*** (the ledger isn't
  scope-indexed; `flag` ignores its `Scope` argument).
* **carrier (b)** — README §III's lfp: "the converged scope is exactly what
  persists." Held open, expected to be **scope-*dependent***. **This file.**

The brick that pointed here predicted `OrderHom.lfp` would type carrier (b)
directly. Walking it surfaced two recognitions that *refine* the prediction
rather than just confirm it — both substrate-forced, both deposited as the
content of this file.

## Recognition 1 — §III's "F is monotone" splits into two independent properties

README §III (line 84): "F is monotone: adding primitives can only enable more
recognition, never less. Recognition never retracts." Under typing this is
**two** clauses, not one:

* **monotonicity** — `S ≤ T → F S ≤ F T` ("more enables more"). In Mathlib this
  is `Monotone`, and bundling it gives `Scope →o Scope`.
* **inflation** — `S ≤ F S` ("never retracts"). This is exactly
  `StatelessSubstrate.Accretive` (`∀ S p, S p → step S p` is `∀ S, S ≤ step S`).

`OrderHom.lfp : (α →o α) →o α` requires the **first** (it is typed on a monotone
bundle). `Accretive` supplies the **second**. They are *independent* lattice
properties — `accretive_not_imp_monotone` (below) exhibits an accretive step
that is not monotone, cashing the independence bin-1. So the `Accretive`
docstring's claim that it is "README §III's monotonicity made concrete" is an
overreach: `Accretive` concretizes the *never-retracts* half, not the
*more-enables-more* half, and it is the latter the lfp needs. Carrier (b) is
therefore **not** built from `Accretive`; it is parameterized by a monotone
`f : Scope →o Scope` — the lfp-ready bundling of §III's F.

## Recognition 2 — "the converged scope" is closure-above-S; the bare lfp is the S=⊥ case

README §III (line 88): "P₀ = initial substrate; P_{n+1} = F(P_n);
lfp(F) = ⋃ P_n." The converged scope is the closure of the *initial substrate*
P₀ under F — i.e. closure-**above-S**, which genuinely depends on S. The bare
`OrderHom.lfp f` is the least fixed point above `⊥` — the `P₀ = ∅` instance — and
so does **not** exercise the `Scope` slot (`lfpFlag_scope_indep`). The
scope-*dependent* carrier (b) the brick asked for is `convergeFrom f S`
(= `OrderHom.lfp (S ⊔ f ·)`), the closure of `S`; it exercises the slot
(`le_convergeFrom`: `S ≤ convergeFrom f S`, using `S` non-trivially) and
collapses to the bare lfp at `⊥` (`convergeFrom_bot`).

## The (a) ↔ (b) merge — distinct carriers, held open (not collapsed)

The brick asked whether (a) and (b) are *the same flag from two directions* or
*two distinct carriers in merge*. Resolution: **distinct, held in merge**, and
the scope-axis cuts differently than the prior note guessed:

* carrier (a) (`LedgerPersistence.flag`) and the **bare** face of (b)
  (`lfpFlag`) are *both* scope-independent;
* only the **closure** face of (b) (`closureFlag`/`convergeFrom`) is
  scope-dependent.

(a) tracks persistence by *ledger balance* (undischarged debt); (b) by *scope
dynamics* (membership in the converged scope). Identifying them — "a debt is
undischarged iff its read-face is live in the fixed scope" — requires a bridge
relating the ledger to the recognition operator `f`. That bridge is now typed
(below, "The (a) ↔ (b) bridge — typed, and its sign is gauge"):
`LedgerRecognitionBridge LP f`, on the `DesarguesianWitness` template. Walking it
landed the resolution — **the bridge has a sign, and the sign is gauge.** Nothing
in `LP` fixes which way recognition points; two ledger-built operators bracket
the choice — `recognizeUndischarged` (lfp = carrier (a) *exactly*, coincidence)
and `recognizeDischarged` (lfp *complementary* to carrier (a)). Committing which
is `F` is gauge-fixing, the single external commitment / the tamp. So per §IV.d
(merge-don't-fork / bias-delegation) the merge stays held — the carriers are
neither the same flag nor plain negations until the observer fixes the gauge.
The remainder is now sharper: *which gauge does foam's concrete `F` commit to.*

/-! ## Recognition as a monotone operator (the lfp-ready bundling of §III's F)

`Scope = TapePosition → Prop` is a `CompleteLattice` (Pi of the complete lattice
`Prop`), so `OrderHom.lfp` applies. Carrier (b) is parameterized by a monotone
`f : Scope →o Scope` — README §III's recognition operator F bundled with the
*more-enables-more* half of its monotonicity, the half the lfp requires. -/

/-- **Recognition 1, cashed bin-1.** `Accretive` (inflation, §III's *never-retracts*
    half) does **not** entail `Monotone` (§III's *more-enables-more* half, the half
    `OrderHom.lfp` needs). Witnessed by a step that re-lights one fixed read-face
    `⟨g1, read⟩` exactly when its complement `⟨g1, write⟩` is *out* of scope: it only
    ever adds, so it is accretive; but growing the scope to contain `⟨g1, write⟩`
    *removes* the conditional addition, so it is not monotone.

    This is why carrier (b) is parameterized by a monotone `Scope →o Scope` and not
    by an `Accretive` hypothesis: the two properties come apart, and the lfp lives on
    the side `Accretive` does not supply. -/

/-- The **bare lfp flag**: a read-face persists iff it is in the least fixed point of
    recognition above `⊥` — README §III's `lfp(F)` for the empty initial substrate
    `P₀ = ∅`. The `Scope` slot of `Persistence` is **unused** here
    (`lfpFlag_scope_indep`): like carrier (a), this face does *not* exercise the slot.
    It is the `S = ⊥` instance of the scope-dependent `closureFlag` below
    (`convergeFrom_bot`). -/
def lfpFlag (f : Scope →o Scope) : Persistence := fun _S p => OrderHom.lfp f p

/-- The bare lfp flag ignores its `Scope` argument — it is the *global* converged
    scope, not a scope-relative one. (Definitional; stated to make the
    non-exercise of the slot a typed fact, mirroring carrier (a)'s scope-independence.) -/
theorem lfpFlag_scope_indep (f : Scope →o Scope) (S S' : Scope) (p : TapePosition) :
    lfpFlag f S p = lfpFlag f S' p := rfl

/-! ## carrier (b), closure face: the converged scope above S (scope-dependent) -/

/-- The **converged scope above `S`** — the closure of `S` under recognition `f`,
    `OrderHom.lfp (S ⊔ f ·)` = the least fixed point of `f` that contains `S`. This is
    README §III's `lfp(F) = ⋃ Fⁿ(P₀)` with `P₀ = S` (the operator `S ⊔ f ·` is
    monotone because `f` is). It genuinely depends on `S` (`le_convergeFrom`), so it is
    the carrier (b) that *exercises* the `Scope` slot. -/
def convergeFrom (f : Scope →o Scope) (S : Scope) : Scope :=
  OrderHom.lfp ⟨fun X => S ⊔ f X, fun _ _ hab => sup_le_sup_left (f.mono hab) S⟩

/-- The converged scope contains its seed: `S ≤ convergeFrom f S`. This is the
    witness that `convergeFrom` *exercises* the `Scope` slot — `S` appears in the
    output non-trivially (contrast `lfpFlag_scope_indep`). It is also §III's
    "recognition never retracts" recovered as a *consequence* (the closure inflates
    its seed), now downstream of monotonicity rather than assumed as `Accretive`. -/
theorem le_convergeFrom (f : Scope →o Scope) (S : Scope) : S ≤ convergeFrom f S :=
  le_sup_left.trans
    (OrderHom.map_lfp ⟨fun X => S ⊔ f X, fun _ _ hab => sup_le_sup_left (f.mono hab) S⟩).le

/-- At the empty seed `⊥`, the converged scope is the bare lfp: `convergeFrom f ⊥ =
    lfp f`. So the bare `lfpFlag` is exactly the `S = ⊥` (`P₀ = ∅`) instance of the
    scope-dependent closure — the scope-independence of the bare face is the slot
    collapsing precisely at the empty initial substrate. -/
theorem convergeFrom_bot (f : Scope →o Scope) : convergeFrom f ⊥ = OrderHom.lfp f := by
  unfold convergeFrom
  congr 1
  ext X x
  simp

/-- **The closure realizes its seed exactly iff the seed is `f`-closed.**
    `convergeFrom f S = S` precisely when `S` is a prefixed point of `f` (`f S ≤ S`).

    * `←` if `f S ≤ S` then `S ⊔ f S = S`, so `S` is a fixed point of the closure
      operator `X ↦ S ⊔ f X` and the lfp sits at `S` (`OrderHom.lfp_le`), giving
      `convergeFrom f S ≤ S`; `le_convergeFrom` is the other half.
    * `→` the lfp is a fixed point (`OrderHom.map_lfp`), so
      `S ⊔ f (convergeFrom f S) = convergeFrom f S`; substituting the hypothesis
      `convergeFrom f S = S` yields `S ⊔ f S = S`, i.e. `f S ≤ S`.

    This is the hinge for reading the *seed's* gauge (`RecognitionApplier.lean`,
    "Seeded from the ledger"): it cleaves "does the closure equal the seed?" — a
    fixed-point property of the `(step, seed)` pair, blind to any ledger — from
    "what gauge does the seed carry?". So any gauge the seeded closure realizes is
    sourced from the seed, never manufactured by the step; whether realization is
    *exact* (closure `=` seed-gauge) or merely a *lower bound* (closure `⊋`
    seed-gauge) is decided here, gauge-independently, by `f`-closedness. -/

/-- The **scope-dependent persistence-flag** carrier (b) supplies: a read-face persists
    in scope `S` iff it lies in the converged scope above `S` (the closure of `S` under
    recognition). Unlike `lfpFlag` and carrier (a)'s `LedgerPersistence.flag`, this
    *exercises* the `Scope` slot. -/
def closureFlag (f : Scope →o Scope) : Persistence := fun S p => convergeFrom f S p

/-! ## The (a) ↔ (b) bridge — typed, and its sign is gauge

The merge block above named the remainder the two-carrier merge produced:
*relating carrier (a)'s undischarged-debt flag to carrier (b)'s lfp needs a
bridge from the ledger to the recognition operator `f`, which is not in
substrate.* This block types that bridge — and walking it lands a recognition
sharper than the merge anticipated: **the bridge has a sign, and the sign is
gauge** (observer-supplied), not substrate-fixed.

Both carriers in play are scope-independent (the brick's recognition): carrier
(a) `LedgerPersistence.flag` ignores its `Scope`, and the bare lfp `lfpFlag`
does too (`lfpFlag_scope_indep`). So the well-posed bridge is `(a) ↔ lfpFlag`
(both constant in `S`), **not** `(a) ↔ closureFlag` (type-incompatible: the
closure face grows with `S`). The bridge asks: does "`p` backs an undischarged
debt" coincide with "`p ∈ OrderHom.lfp f`"?

**The ledger does not fix `f`.** A `HolonomicLedger` carries a *static*
partition of debts into discharged / undischarged (`Discharged`), but it does
not say which way a recognition operator built over it *points*. Two natural
ledger-built operators bracket the choice — they differ only in which side of
the partition recognition accretes:

* `recognizeUndischarged` — accrete the **still-owed** read-faces. Its bare lfp
  is *exactly* carrier (a): `LP.flag = lfpFlag (recognizeUndischarged LP)`
  (`flag_eq_lfpFlag_recognizeUndischarged`). **Coincidence** — README §V's "a
  debt is undischarged iff its read-face is live in the fixed scope," now a
  theorem at this gauge.
* `recognizeDischarged` — accrete the **settled** read-faces. Its bare lfp is
  the discharged-backing set, which is **complementary** to carrier (a): under
  `holds`-injectivity, on any debt-backed face `lfp ↔ ¬ LP.flag`
  (`lfp_iff_not_flag_of_injective`), and coincidence is outright *impossible*
  there (`not_coincide_recognizeDischarged_of_injective`).

So the *sign* of the (a) ↔ (b) relation — coincide vs. complement — is fixed by
which operator the observer commits to as `F`. The ledger-geometry alone is
sign-free; committing the gauge is the **single external commitment / the tamp**
(README §IV.a, §VIII): generation and uncertainty in one act. This is why the
merge stayed held distinct — the two carriers are neither the same flag nor
plain negations until a gauge is fixed, and the gauge is the observer's.

**Grade.** The bridge over an arbitrary `f` is bin-2, observer-supplied
(`LedgerRecognitionBridge`, on the `DesarguesianWitness` template). It is
*discharged for free at the `recognizeUndischarged` gauge*
(`LedgerRecognitionBridge.ofRecognizeUndischarged`, bin-1 — the substrate fills
the slot, as `DesarguesianWitness` is inhabited when `L = Sub(D, V)`) and
*refuted at the `recognizeDischarged` gauge*
(`not_bridge_recognizeDischarged_of_injective`). The remainder is therefore not
"is there a bridge" (there is, at one gauge) but "which gauge does foam's
*concrete* `F` commit to." **Answered in `RecognitionApplier.lean`:** foam's `F`
(the `applyRules` rewrite-applier) is sign-*neutral*. It is *gated* (a rule fires
only when its whole read-triple is in scope) where these toy operators are
*ungated* (`S ↦ S ⊔ Q`), so its bare lfp is `⊥` (`applyRules_lfp_bot`: nothing fires
from nothing) — it equals neither gauge and never reads `Discharged`. Hence
`LedgerRecognitionBridge LP (applyRules rules)` is inhabited **iff the ledger is
fully discharged** (`nonempty_bridge_applyRules_iff`), i.e. only where carrier (a)
is itself `⊥`. So the gauge is the tamp — observer-supplied at the ledger, in the
gap between rule-firing and discharge-status — and the bridge stays **bin-2** in
foam proper. **Refined once more** (RecognitionApplier's "Seeded from the ledger"):
the bare lfp is `⊥` only because `P₀ = ∅`; running the applier from a *seed*
(`convergeFrom`, the carrier-(b) closure below) localizes the tamp precisely — `F`
is sign-neutral, so the gauge enters through the **seed `P₀`**, and the
undischarged-vs-discharged seed-choice is this very coincide/complement fork
relocated from the step to the initial substrate. -/

/-! ## The seed-gauge is a `{+, −, 0}` triple — the gauge-neutral `0` is the join of the `±` fork

`RecognitionApplier.lean` localized the tamp to the **seed** `P₀` and found the
undischarged- vs discharged-backed seed-choice is the coincide/complement gauge-fork
(`seed_fork_of_injective`). Those are the `±` *signs*. But a fork has a third,
distinguished point — the **join** — and it is already sitting in `lfp_or_flag_of_backed`:
the **all-debt-backed** seed

> `seedBacked LP := fun p => ∃ d, LP.holds d = p`

backs *every* debt regardless of discharge-status. `lfp_or_flag_of_backed` shows every
backed face is undischarged-backed ∨ discharged-backed; the reverse drops the
discharge-condition. So `seedBacked` is *exactly* the join of the two fork-seeds
(`seedBacked_eq_join`) — it carries **both** signs at once, hence is **gauge-neutral**:
the `0` of a `{+, −, 0}` seed-triple, with `⊥` (the `P₀ = ∅` empty seed) below.

This block types that triple (`SeedSign`) and lands the recognition that the seed-gauge
is **not a bare 2-fork** but a three-element structure with a distinguished neutral
element — `0 = + ⊔ −`. The grading: under `holds`-injectivity the `0` seed is *distinct*
from both `±` exactly when the ledger carries both a discharged and an undischarged debt
(`SeedSign.zero_ne_plus_of_injective` / `zero_ne_minus_of_injective`); where it carries
only one kind, the triple collapses. (The closures of these seeds over foam's real gated
`F` are read off in `RecognitionApplier.lean`; the `0`-seed's closure dominates both
`±`-fork closures via `convergeFrom_mono_seed`.) -/

/-- The **all-debt-backed seed** — the gauge-neutral `0` of the seed-triple. A read-face is
    in it iff it backs *some* debt, discharged or not. Contrast the two fork-seeds
    (`recognizeUndischarged_lfp` / `recognizeDischarged_lfp`), which each carry a
    discharge-sign; `seedBacked` carries neither, hence both (`seedBacked_eq_join`). -/

/-- **The gauge-neutral seed is the join of the `±` fork (bin-1).**
    `seedBacked LP = lfp (recognizeUndischarged LP) ⊔ lfp (recognizeDischarged LP)`.
    Forward is `lfp_or_flag_of_backed` (every backed face is on one side of the fork);
    reverse drops the discharge-condition. So `0 = + ⊔ −`: the all-debt-backed seed carries
    both signs, the structural reason it is gauge-neutral. -/
