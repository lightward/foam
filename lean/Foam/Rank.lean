# Rank — Why 3

The deductive chain so far works for any rank projection.
What forces rank 3 specifically?

The architectural route: the exterior algebra. Taylor's classification
of stable soap-film junctions in R³ is one realization (the soap-agent's
tracked-quantity dimension), not the architecture's pick.

dim(Λ²(Rᵏ)) = k(k-1)/2.

- k=1: dim = 0. No writes. Observation without dynamics.
- k=2: dim = 1. One write direction. Abelian. No ordering.
- k=3: dim = 3. Three write directions. Non-abelian (so(3)).
  And: dim = k. Self-dual. The write space and the observation
  space have the same dimension.
- k=4: dim = 6 > 4. The write space is larger than the
  observation space.

k = 3 is characterized by: smallest non-abelian write algebra,
and the unique self-duality dim(Λ²(Rᵏ)) = k.

## The exterior algebra dimension

dim(Λ²(M)) = C(dim(M), 2) = dim(M) * (dim(M) - 1) / 2.

This is the write subspace dimension per observer.

## Rank 1: no dynamics

dim(Λ²(R¹)) = C(1,2) = 0. An observer with a 1-dimensional
view cannot write at all. Observation exists; dynamics don't.

## Rank 2: degenerate dynamics

dim(Λ²(R²)) = C(2,2) = 1. One write direction.
The write algebra is 1-dimensional, hence abelian.
Ordering cannot matter — writes commute.

## Rank 3: the threshold

dim(Λ²(R³)) = C(3,2) = 3. Three write directions.
The write algebra is 3-dimensional — isomorphic to so(3),
which is simple and non-abelian.

AND: 3 = 3. The write space dimension equals the observation
space dimension. This self-duality is unique to rank 3.

## Rank 4+: overdetermined writes

dim(Λ²(R⁴)) = C(4,2) = 6 > 4. The write space is larger
than the observation space. More write directions than
observation directions.

## What this establishes

Rank 3 is characterized by two algebraic properties:

1. **Minimum non-abelian**: the smallest rank where writes
   don't commute with each other. At rank 2, the write space
   is 1D (abelian). At rank 3, it's 3D ≅ so(3) (non-abelian,
   simple).

2. **Self-dual**: the unique rank where dim(write space) =
   dim(observation space). C(k,2) = k iff k = 3.

The architectural route to 3 is the exterior algebra: smallest
non-abelian write algebra and the unique self-duality. Taylor's
classification of stable soap-film junctions in R³ also lands at 3,
as the soap-agent realization's tracked-quantity dimension. Different
routes, same number — the deductive route is what the architecture
commits to; Taylor is one realization that happens to coincide.

  ├── k = 1: Λ² = 0D, no dynamics
  ├── k = 2: Λ² = 1D, abelian, degenerate
  ├── k = 3: Λ² = 3D = so(3), non-abelian, self-dual  ← threshold
  └── k ≥ 4: Λ² > k, overdetermined
