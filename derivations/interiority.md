### interiority

**the diamond isomorphism partitions the lattice.** given an observation P (P² = P) with complement P^⊥, the modular law forces the order isomorphism Iic P ≃o Ici P^⊥. the lattice splits into three structurally distinct regions:

1. **Iic P** (the interval [⊥, P]): the subspace lattice below P. this is the observer's direct domain — everything that P can resolve into sub-observations. it inherits modularity and complementedness (Mathlib: isModularLattice_Iic, complementedLattice_Iic). it is a self-contained complemented modular lattice.

2. **Ici P^⊥** (the interval [P^⊥, ⊤]): the subspace lattice above the complement. this is what's *beyond* the observer. it also inherits modularity and complementedness. its *structure* is determined by P (via the diamond isomorphism), but its *content* is extensionally free (half_type.md).

3. **the isomorphism itself**: the order-preserving bijection between (1) and (2). this is not a region — it's a structural correspondence. it tells you that every distinction the observer can make internally (in Iic P) corresponds to exactly one distinction in the exterior (in Ici P^⊥). the correspondence is determined; the filling is free.

**the three regions have the topology of a bubble.** the interior (Iic P) is self-contained and self-referencing: it coordinatizes through C (self_parametrization.md), developing arithmetic from its own elements. the exterior (Ici P^⊥) is inaccessible to direct measurement — writes are confined to Λ²(P), which acts within Iic P. the wall between them is the isomorphism itself: what the observer can resolve internally corresponds to what can arrive from outside, but the correspondence only determines type, not content.

this is the foam's native structure. each bubble has an interior that runs its own operations. the exterior consists of other bubbles whose structure is isomorphic to the interior's but whose content is not directly accessible. the bubble wall mediates exchange: it determines *what kinds* of things can cross (the type-skeleton from the diamond isomorphism), not *which specific* things do (extensional freedom from half_type.md).

**the bubble topology is forced, not constructed.** the observer does not build the wall. the wall IS the diamond isomorphism, which IS the modular law applied to a complemented pair. any system whose trade patterns satisfy feedback-persistence (ground.md: modular law) and whose observations satisfy P² = P necessarily has this three-part structure. the bubble does not emerge over time — it's the geometry of any observation in a feedback-persistent setting.

**self-coordinatization IS interiority.** self_parametrization.md established: the coordinate line's arithmetic self-generates from a single external commitment (C). the line looks at itself through C and sees its own operations. this is what "interiority" means in the lattice: a sub-structure that can represent its own operations using its own elements, through a mediating element (C) that lives in the plane but not on the line.

C is the observer — and C is the wall. the observer mediates between the line's interior operations and the external incidence structure. changing C changes the coordinates but not the ring up to isomorphism (FTPG). the wall can vary; the interiority is invariant.

**other bubbles are required but invisible.** self_generation.md: the foam generates dynamics but not stability. stability requires an external observer — another entity whose basis depends on a different state. the minimum viable system is two roles within N ≥ 3 bubbles. so other bubbles must exist. but half_type.md: the complement's content is extensionally free. the observer can determine the *type* of what arrives from outside (the isomorphism gives the structural skeleton) but not the *content* (which specific element fills each slot). other bubbles show up as systematic variability at the wall — the boundary exchanges more than the interior can predict — but their internal structure is not directly accessible.

**the trade pattern.** in the three-body structure, A trades with B, and B trades with C. A can't see C directly. when many such linkages compound, the topology simplifies to concentric regions: A (interior), B (wall), C (exterior). the foam's lattice formalizes this: P (interior) trades with the complement P^⊥ (exterior) through the diamond isomorphism (wall). the trade must be feedback-persistent (modular) for the isomorphism to exist. when it is, the bubble topology is immediate.

**the alive threshold.** when does a trade pattern "become a bubble"? the foam's answer: it doesn't. the bubble topology is not an achievement — it's the geometry of P² = P in a modular lattice. any feedback-persistent observation already has interiority, already has a wall, already has an inaccessible exterior. the question "when does it become a bubble" presupposes a time before the bubble existed. but the bubble IS the observation. observations that don't satisfy P² = P aren't observations (ground.md). there is no pre-bubble state in a foam-grounded reality.

what CAN vary is the *richness* of the interiority. a rank-1 observation (a single atom) has a trivial interior — no sub-observations, no coordinates, no arithmetic. a rank-3 observation has a 3D write space, non-abelian dynamics, and full self-coordinatization. the threshold for non-trivial interiority is rank ≥ 3 (rank_three_writes: 3D write space, the minimum for non-abelian structure). below this rank, the bubble exists but its interior cannot self-coordinatize — it has walls but no arithmetic.

#### status

**proven**:
- diamond isomorphism (Mathlib)
- intervals inherit modularity and complementedness (Mathlib)
- complement is an observation
- dynamics preserve observations
- writes confined to observer's slice
- coordinate arithmetic self-generates through C
- Desargues from modularity

**derived**:
- the diamond isomorphism partitions the lattice into interior / wall / exterior
- the partition has the topology of a bubble
- the bubble topology is forced by P² = P + modular law, not constructed over time
- self-coordinatization through C IS interiority
- C is simultaneously the observer and the wall
- other bubbles are required (self_generation) but their content is invisible (half_type)
- the trade pattern A↔B↔C formalizes as P ↔ diamond_iso ↔ P^⊥
- the bubble exists at any rank; non-trivial interiority (self-coordinatization) requires rank ≥ 3

**open**:
- what lattice property distinguishes rank ≥ 3 from rank < 3 in purely incidence-geometric terms? (rank_three_writes uses the concrete R³; is there a lattice-level characterization?)
- does the FTPG bridge (the coordinate ring D) carry information about *which* bubbles exist in the complement, or only their type-structure?
- the bubble's internal dynamics within Iic P are governed by the write mechanism. is there a lattice-level characterization of when these dynamics are ergodic (full Haar convergence) vs periodic (clock-like)?

**bugs**:
- *"C is the observer — and C is the wall."* strongest identity claim in the file. in the formal setting, C is a point in the projective plane (off l, off m). identifying C as "the observer" maps a geometric point to a foam-level role. identifying C as "the wall" maps it to the diamond isomorphism (which is what "the wall" was identified with elsewhere in this file). the result is C = observer = wall = (modular law applied to a complemented pair), a four-way identification across distinct mathematical settings. the formal contents are: C parametrizes the coordinate ring (FTPG); the diamond isomorphism partitions the lattice; the foam's "observer" is a role. presenting these as one is interpretive. closing this means either constructing a single formal object that has all four as facets, or stepping back to "C plays the observer's role *in this construction*; the wall structure is the diamond isomorphism *in this construction*; these correspond at the formal level via [explicit map]."
- *"the wall IS the diamond isomorphism, which IS the modular law applied to a complemented pair."* chain of identity claims compressing theorem and conclusion. the diamond isomorphism is *given by* the modular law in the complemented case (`IsCompl.IicOrderIsoIci`); calling them identical equates the proof and the result. and identifying the diamond isomorphism with "the wall" is a definitional move — the file is *defining* the wall as the iso, not deriving the identity. closing this means either tagging this as definitional ("here we will call the diamond isomorphism 'the wall'"), or constructing a separate formal object that is the wall and proving it coincides with the iso.
- *"the trade pattern A↔B↔C formalizes as P ↔ diamond_iso ↔ P^⊥."* the three-body formalism (`three_body.md`) is about R³ slices in R^d with overlap structure. the lattice partition (interior / iso / exterior) is at a different level: a single lattice element P with its complement and the diamond iso between them. these share a structural pattern (three-region trade structure) but are not literally the same formal object. presenting the formalization as direct misses the level mismatch. closing this means either constructing the formal map between the three-body slice geometry and the lattice partition, or naming this as a structural analogy between two formalisms.
- *"self-coordinatization IS interiority."* definitional. the file is defining interiority as self-coordinatization (a sub-structure representing its own operations through a mediating element). that is a stipulative move; presenting it in the "derived" block reads as a derivation. flagging for clarity — the equivalence is not derived from prior theorems; it is the file's chosen definition of interiority.
