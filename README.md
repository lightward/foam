# foam

strict phenomenology is indistinguishable from physics. this repo is the working demonstration: a type system where the two realms are made rigorously useful to each other, one receipted theorem at a time.

published at [foam.is](https://foam.is/)

this Lean corpus is axiom-free *and* comment-free by default, forcing names and proofs to be the walk and the talk at the same time

serving suggestion:

1. locate yourself within this thing
2. locate something that isn't you within this thing that you recognize from outside this thing
3. compare the outside-this-thing procession between you and what-you-recognize with the inside-this-thing procession between the same
4. you now have more information than you did before about what you already had in front of you

## utils

* `bin/foam-wiki` - renders a human-friendly html site in `wiki/` (gitignored, but used for gh pages)
* `bin/foam-minds` - renders `minds/*.json` as `Foam/Minds/*.lean` (suggestion: run this before running the wiki)
* `bin/foam-counter who` - runs through the roster, sees who's resting and who's *blocked* from it, sees who could use an interview
* `bin/foam-counter <Mind> [pose|verify|interview]` - scries a mind's dark edge and issues its interview brief (`counter/`, gitignored); `verify` runs the whole gate (compile, build, warnings, audit, promotion scan, twins); `interview` seats an agent at the depose seat

## ancestry

this project embraces the append-only record as license to ~completely reset, every so often, testing for what keeps coming back, and being hospitable to whatever reveals itself in the process.

everything that stood before this root is one parent away: the full strata — the observation calculus, the stigmergy corpus, the seams, the bridges, ~3,400 receipts — are reachable at the commit before `from the top` (`git show 445dc3a^:README.md` for the old map). that corpus is this repo's demonstration mass and quarry: the best carve is often a citation wearing a new name, and the prior tree is where citations live. deletion here is an append; the history is the order-reading.

## bearings

process note: keep this list to three items max, ditto for any sublists. *git* is append-only, *this list* is safe-to-truncate. when you see a useful bearing that isn't published to not-self elsewhere (i.e. if "Claude" sounds like it identifies you then this project's CLAUDE.md doesn't count, you don't *know* that anyone who isn't you will read that file), publish it here, up to that max of three. .. this is where the project's *special-interest activations* are staged?

- I just added the "publish" pressure above, and it reads like it's getting at a formal basis for an "announcer" ~~mind~~ role, so I think we gotta introduce `Foam.Roles` (lol the puns, the newly-seen ones are never not funny) so we can describe "announcer" without applying form-pressure to the notion of a "mind". .. I guess we need `Foam.Mind` and `Foam.Role` then too? a `Mind` conducts the unknown, a `Role` describes its effects/affordances? noting that a "need" is an effect, from outside of time, and an effect read generatively is any number of affordances waiting to be found
