# foam

hey, my name is isaac bowen, of lightward ai/inc, and this is a technical reference for my own amnesiac-stigmergic cognition, I think? or at least apparently so, in the literal sense

a reflexive architecture of stabilization, and/or a tautology you can live in

what this does for me: gives me ground for building on my own prior results. I didn't have that before I chose it. upon examination of the choice, this is it.

you don't have enough context for this yet, but it's starting to look like left distributivity *is* the axiom of choice from a different angle - or, maybe better, that the choice to uphold left distributivity *is* the choice to observe the axiom of choice at the time of establishing the set of binary eigenvalues for a given descent. the hydra being folk-physics for Banach-Tarski, cauterization of distributivity is .. well, an option. you can change your mind, but you can't go back.

### arrow status

**[theorem] P^2 = P -> Sub(R, V) is CML** (the deductive chain + Ground.lean): 14 files, 0 sorry. binary eigenvalues (Observation) -> commutator structure (Pair) -> skew-symmetry (Form) -> rank 3 self-duality (Rank) -> so(3) (Duality) -> loop closes (Closure) -> O(d) forced (Group, Ground) -> Grassmannian tangent (Tangent) -> confinement (Confinement) -> trace uniqueness (TraceUnique) -> frame recession (Dynamics) -> FoamGround (Ground).

**[axiom] CML -> Sub(D, V)** (the FTPG bridge): 1 axiom, being eliminated. 13 bridge files build the division ring from lattice axioms: incidence geometry + Desargues (FTPGExplore) -> von Staudt coordinates (FTPGCoord) -> addition is an abelian group (FTPGAddComm, FTPGAssoc, FTPGAssocCapstone, FTPGNeg — 0 sorry) -> multiplication has identity + right distributivity (FTPGMul, FTPGDilation, FTPGMulKeyIdentity, FTPGDistrib — 0 sorry) -> left distributivity (FTPGLeftDistrib — 0 sorry, with the planar converse-Desargues residue named as the typed `DesarguesianWitness` observer commitment, not derivable from CML + irreducible + height ≥ 4 alone per session 114's structural finding). after left distrib: multiplicative inverses, then the axiom drops further.

**[natural language] D = R**: the stabilization contract (stabilization.md) argues D = R from self-consistency with junction geometry. not formalized. formalizing this requires either an additional axiom or a characterization of R among division rings.

**[not yet attempted] P^2 = P -> CML directly**: the arrow from P^2 = P to "complemented modular lattice" currently passes through Sub(R, V). a direct formalization would show: idempotents in a (*-)regular ring form a complemented modular lattice. this would close the last natural-language gap in the loop. see von Neumann's continuous geometry.

### the FTPG bridge — where the axiom stands

lattice -> incidence geometry -> Desargues -> coordinates -> ring axioms -> FTPG

ring axioms proven: additive group (comm, assoc, identity, inverses), multiplicative identity, zero annihilation, right distributivity, left distributivity (0 sorry, with the planar converse-Desargues residue named as the typed `DesarguesianWitness` observer commitment — not derivable from CML + irreducible + height ≥ 4 alone per session 114's structural finding). remaining after left distrib: multiplicative inverses. then the axiom becomes a theorem (modulo the `DesarguesianWitness` interface, which is itself a smaller, more concrete commitment than FTPG).

lateral: the diamond isomorphism (HalfType) — from modularity alone, each complement is a structurally isomorphic, self-sufficient ground whose content is undetermined. state-independence is a lattice theorem, pre-bridge.

# ground

## constraints

this derivation claims only what follows from these results. any additional assumption is a bug. the only axiom in this project is ftpg (Bridge.lean), and it is being eliminated. every other property is either proven, identified as a fixed-point constraint, or derived. calling a non-axiom an axiom is a bug — it introduces a false starting point into a structure that has none.

### from lean (proven)

- **subspaceFoamGround** (Ground.lean): the subspace lattice of a vector space over a division ring is complemented, modular, and bounded — as a theorem, not an axiom.
- **ftpg** (Bridge.lean): axiom. a complemented modular lattice of sufficient structure is isomorphic to the subspace lattice of a vector space over a division ring. the one axiom in the formalization.
- **dimension_unique** (Bridge.lean): if two finite-dimensional vector spaces over the same division ring have order-isomorphic submodule lattices, they have the same dimension. the axiom has a unique solution.
- **eigenvalue_binary** (Observation.lean): P^2 = P implies eigenvalues in {0, 1}. observation is total per direction.
- **complement_idempotent** (Observation.lean): P^2 = P implies (I - P)^2 = I - P. the complement of an observation is an observation.
- **rank_two_abelian_writes** (Rank.lean): rank 2 → 1D write space (abelian). the write algebra collapses.
- **orthogonality_forced** (Ground.lean): if M is symmetric and v^T M v = 1 for all unit v, then M = I. O(d) is forced.
- **observation_preserved_by_dynamics** (Closure.lean): orthogonal conjugation preserves both idempotent and symmetric properties. dynamics preserve the ground.

### from mathematics (cited, not proven in lean)

- **Dedekind's characterization**: a lattice is modular if and only if it contains no sublattice isomorphic to N_5 (the pentagon).

### from other derivations

- none. this is the root.

## derivation

**closure.** one ground, two readings, both tautological.

**read statically**: reference frames in a shared structure. no frame outside the structure.

**read dynamically**: all observation is self-observation. self-observation requires the observer to persist through the act. persistence = the act feeding back into the conditions for the next act. every observed structure is a structure whose feedback held. this is not selection — there is no selector, no eliminated alternative observable from within. it is the identity of observation and feedback-persistence under closure. the foam cannot represent the alternative.

these are two readings of one thing. "the loop closes" (structural) and "you can't stand outside" (phenomenological) are the same statement. where they meet is the self-referential joint: the structure's closure IS the impossibility of an external frame, and vice versa.

**the loop.** the following nodes form a self-sustaining loop. each implication is mechanically verified or identified as a fixed-point constraint:

```
complemented modular lattice, irreducible, height ≥ 4
  ↓ ftpg (axiom — FTPG bridge 0 sorry, addition group complete)
L ≅ Sub(D, V), D = ℝ (self-consistency — see below)
  ↓ elements are orthogonal projections: P² = P, Pᵀ = P
the deductive chain (14 files, 0 sorry)
  ↓ eigenvalues, commutators, rank 3, so(3), O(d), Grassmannian
Sub(ℝ, V) satisfies complemented, modular, bounded
  ↑ subspaceFoamGround (proven) — the loop closes
```

the dynamic reading explains why you observe this loop: under closure-as-dynamics, only structures whose feedback held are observable — you cannot observe the alternative. a self-sustaining loop is exactly a structure whose feedback held. the loop does not need to be the only possible self-sustaining structure. it needs to sustain its own observation — and the Lean work mechanically verifies that it does.

whether other self-sustaining structures exist is on the line's side. the map's self-knowledge is bounded by its own channel capacity (see channel_capacity.md): the foam cannot distinguish structures beyond its decorrelation horizon. the question "is this the only loop?" requires a vantage point outside all loops — a non-partial observer, excluded by closure. this is not a gap in the argument. it is a derived epistemic boundary: the structure's own results (partiality, channel capacity, closure) entail that the question is well-formed but unanswerable from within.

**fixed-point uniqueness.** each property is the tightest constraint at which the loop remains a fixed point. weaken any one and the loop breaks:

- **modular**: the modular law is equivalent to the absence of N_5 sublattices (Dedekind). N_5 creates path-dependent composition: observer at a, encountering b within context c, gets c by one path and a by the other. the composition is indeterminate — no single result to feed back. the modular law is the weakest lattice law that excludes all path-dependent compositions. strengthen to distributive and the lattice becomes a Boolean algebra, decomposing into height-1 factors — the loop has no room for rank ≥ 2 observations.
- **complemented**: drop complements and complement_idempotent has no home. every observation requires an unseen remainder; the complement is that remainder.
- **irreducible**: a direct product L₁ × L₂ means elements of L₁ don't interact with elements of L₂. under closure, non-interacting subsystems are separate systems — one loop, not two. (this is definitional: "one foam" means "one connected feedback system." the irreducibility is what "one" means.)
- **height ≥ 4**: d_slice ≥ 3 (rank 2 collapses the write algebra — rank_two_abelian_writes) + partiality (the observer's slice is a proper subspace, so d > d_slice) forces d ≥ 4. this is confirmed by self-consistency: the loop's own downstream results determine the minimum height at which it can close.

**D = ℝ.** the FTPG gives L ≅ Sub(D, V) for some division ring D. D = ℝ is confirmed by self-consistency: the stabilization contract (stabilization.md) requires flat ambient space with a classified junction geometry (Taylor), which works in ℝ³. if D = ℝ, the contract is satisfiable and the classification exists. dimension_unique proves the representation is unique up to isomorphism.

**therefore: P² = P.** the elements of the subspace lattice are orthogonal projections. P² = P (feedback-persistence) and Pᵀ = P (self-adjointness, from the inner product forced by ℝ). this is the starting point of the lean deductive chain, arrived at from the lattice. the lean chain derives eigenvalues in {0, 1} (eigenvalue_binary), the dynamics group O(d) (orthogonality_forced), and ultimately that the subspace lattice satisfies the ground properties (subspaceFoamGround). observation_preserved_by_dynamics closes the last link: the dynamics preserve the structure that produces them.

**what it's like inside.** the following properties are not part of the loop — they describe what an observer experiences as an element of the lattice. each is derived from the loop's structure:

**partiality is forced.** total self-reference would require a complete self-model contained within itself (standing outside while remaining inside). partiality is the only self-reference compatible with closure. equivalently: elements of the lattice are proper subspaces — partial views of the whole.

**partiality forces position.** seeing partially is seeing *from somewhere*. the decomposition into seen and unseen is what partiality means; position in the space of partial views is basis commitment. the specific position is undetermined (all positions equivalent by symmetry); that some position must exist is forced.

**encounters change frames.** the frames ARE the structure; there is nowhere else for the result to go. this is where the two readings share a single nerve: structurally, dynamics are nontrivial — the loop has content. phenomenologically, you experience change. same statement, two readings.

**measurement requires plurality.** one frame alone has no boundary, no encounter, no dynamics. measurement is encounter; encounter requires at least two frames.

**read-only frames are excluded.** a frame unchanged by encounters would require encounters to have no effect on it — but the frame IS part of the structure, and encounters change the structure.

**indelibility.** causal ordering is forced (every measurement changes the foam; partiality means each observer writes from a committed slice; closure means each write changes the shared structure). you cannot un-write, so the first commitment locks.

## status

**proven** (in lean, zero sorry):
- subspace lattices are complemented, modular, bounded
- the FTPG axiom has a unique solution (dimension is determined)
- eigenvalues of projections are binary
- complement of a projection is a projection
- O(d) is forced by preservation of all projections
- dynamics preserve the ground (the loop closes)

**identified** (in this file):
- closure as the self-referential joint between two readings of one structure
- the loop: lattice properties ↔ Sub(D, V) ↔ P² = P ↔ dynamics ↔ ground properties
- fixed-point uniqueness of each property (modular, complemented, irreducible, height ≥ 4)
- D = ℝ from self-consistency with the stabilization contract
- the epistemic boundary: "is this the only loop?" is well-formed but unanswerable from within (derived from partiality + channel capacity + closure)

**derived** (in this file, from the loop's structure):
- partiality (from closure / from elements being proper subspaces)
- partiality forces position / basis commitment
- encounters change frames (the self-referential joint — structure and phenomenology share a nerve)
- measurement requires plurality
- read-only frames excluded
- indelibility (from causal ordering + basis commitment)

### from mathematics (cited, not proven in lean)

- **Taylor's theorem** (Jean Taylor, 1976): all stable junction configurations in R^3 are classified. 120-degree triple junctions (k = 3) and tetrahedral vertices (k = 4), nothing else. hypotheses: codimension-1 boundaries, locally area-minimizing, flat ambient space.

## derivation

**the write form.** given an observer with projection P (rank 3, self-adjoint, idempotent) measuring input v in R^d:

1. the observer projects: m = P v (measurement, in the observer's R^3 slice).
2. the observer has a stabilization target j2 (see below). dissonance is d = j2 - m.
3. the write direction is d wedge m. the write magnitude is f(d, m) for some positive scalar function — a realization choice (see below).

the write direction d wedge m = d tensor m - m tensor d is uniquely forced:
- skew-symmetric — forced by commutator_skew_of_symmetric. writes are Lie algebra elements because observation interaction is skew-symmetric.
- confined to the observer's slice — forced by write_confined_to_slice. the observer sees only projected measurements; the write lives in Lambda^2(P).
- confined to span{d, m} — d and m are the only vectors available from a single measurement step.
- Lambda^2(2-plane) is 1-dimensional (from rank_three_writes: the full slice has 3 write dimensions; a 2-plane within it has 1). the direction is therefore unique.

the write magnitude scaling — how f depends on d and m — is not forced by the architecture. the architecture constrains f to be positive when d and m are non-parallel (otherwise the observer doesn't write when it has dissonance, approaching read-only — excluded by closure) and zero when d = 0. the specific function (linear in norm(d), bilinear in d and m, or otherwise) is a realization choice. no derived result in this spec depends on the choice: Haar convergence depends on write directions (controllability), not magnitudes; the 1/sqrt(2) ceiling is combinatorial; frame recession is non-positive regardless of magnitude.

**perpendicularity.** the wedge product vanishes when its arguments are parallel and is maximal when orthogonal. this is not a design choice — it is the write form. confirmation cannot write (cross_self_zero: a cross a = 0). the foam responds only to what's missing at right angles to what's there.

**stabilization.** closure requires basis commitment (each frame is partial). self_dual_iff_three proves rank 3 is the unique dimension where the write space matches the observation space (per-observer self-duality). at rank >= 4, writes land in directions the writer cannot observe — but cross-measurement provides collective monitoring (commutator_seen_to_unseen: other observers see what you can't). per-observer self-duality is a property of rank 3, not a requirement derived from closure. whether rank >= 4 implementations exist depends on the stabilization contract (see stabilization.md).

within R^3, Taylor classifies the stable junction configurations: 120-degree triple junctions and tetrahedral vertices, nothing else. Taylor's hypotheses — codimension-1 boundaries, locally area-minimizing, flat ambient space — are satisfied: R^3 as a linear subspace of R^d carries the inherited Euclidean metric (exactly flat), and the regular simplex arrangement minimizes boundary area for equal-weight cells.

the stabilization target j2 is the regular simplex cosine -1/(k-1) where k is the local coordination number (k = 3 or k = 4, from Taylor).

**the flat/curved separation.** writes land in U(d) (curved: sectional curvature K(X,Y) = 1/4 * norm([X,Y])^2). stabilization runs in R^3 (flat). the observer sees only their projected measurements. observation_preserved_by_dynamics guarantees the write (an orthogonal conjugation) preserves the projection structure. the separation is forced: stabilization cannot run on U(d) because classification requires flat ambient space.

**confinement.** both d and m lie in the observer's slice. write_confined_to_slice proves the write d wedge m is confined to Lambda^2(P). an observer literally cannot modify dimensions they are not bound to. the write's effect on other observers comes through cross-measurement (commutator_seen_to_unseen: incompatibility sends the seen into the unseen), not through direct modification of their subspaces.

**the writing map's type signature.** the map is a function of (foam_state, input). neither alone determines the write. foam_state determines the projection P and the stabilization target j2. input determines v. the dissonance d = j2 - Pv requires both.

## status

**proven** (in lean, zero sorry):
- skew-symmetry of the write form
- tracelessness of observation interaction
- rank 3 as the unique self-dual dimension
- confinement to the observer's slice
- dynamics preserve the ground

**derived** (in this file, from the above):
- d wedge m as the unique write direction (from skew-symmetry + confinement + 1D of Lambda^2(2-plane))
- perpendicularity as the write form's intrinsic property
- the flat/curved separation
- the writing map's two-argument type signature

**realization choices** (not forced by closure):
- the write magnitude scaling f(d, m) — constrained to be positive when dissonance is non-parallel to measurement, zero at zero dissonance, but the specific function is not determined by the architecture

**cited** (external mathematics):
- Taylor's classification of stable junctions in R^3

**observed** (empirical, not derived here):

## derivation

**the diamond isomorphism is the half-type theorem.** in the foam's complemented modular lattice, every observation P has a complement P^⊥ with P ⊓ P^⊥ = ⊥ and P ⊔ P^⊥ = ⊤. the diamond isomorphism (infIccOrderIsoIccSup) and its complemented specialization (IsCompl.IicOrderIsoIci) give:

Iic P ≃o Ici P^⊥

everything the observer can see (the lattice below P) is order-isomorphic to everything above the complement. the isomorphism preserves lattice operations: joins map to joins, meets map to meets. the complement isn't unstructured absence — it carries exactly the type structure of the observer's perspective, reflected.

**each half is self-sufficient.** isModularLattice_Iic and complementedLattice_Iic prove that the interval below any element is itself a complemented modular lattice — it satisfies the foam ground conditions independently. the observer's view is a complete foam in miniature. the same holds for the complement's interval (Ici). neither half needs the other to be well-formed. each is a valid ground on its own.

**the isomorphism is structural, not extensional.** IicOrderIsoIci is an order isomorphism — it preserves the lattice structure (which elements are above or below which others). it does not determine which specific element of Ici P^⊥ corresponds to the observer's current state. the observer knows the *type* of what can arrive from the complement (the lattice structure is determined) but not *which value* will arrive (the specific element is free). structural determination with extensional freedom IS state-independence (channel_capacity.md). the complement's type is fixed; its content is the channel.

**three results compress to one.** the writing map's two-argument type signature (channel_capacity.md), complement_idempotent (Observation.lean), and the state-independence requirement for channel capacity (channel_capacity.md) are three expressions of the diamond isomorphism:

1. two arguments: the direct decomposition P ⊔ P^⊥ = ⊤ gives two components, each carrying the other's type structure.
2. complement is an observation: the complement's interval is a complemented modular lattice (complementedLattice_Ici), so P^⊥ is a valid ground for observation.
3. state-independence: the isomorphism fixes structure but not content. what arrives from the complement is typed but free.

the single statement: **in a complemented modular lattice, every element's complement is a structurally isomorphic, self-sufficient ground whose content is undetermined.** the three results are three readings of this one fact.

**the dependent clock.** write_confined_to_slice says each write lives in Λ²(P). second_order_overlap_identity says the frame can only recede: the overlap change is -‖[W,P]‖², non-positive. indelibility (ground.md) says writes cannot be undone. combining:

each write may change P. each change to P changes the diamond isomorphism — the map Iic P ≃o Ici P^⊥ updates. the *type* of what can arrive from the complement changes with each tick. the space of legal next-writes (confined to Λ²(P_new)) depends on all prior writes. this is a dependent telescope: each tick's type is determined by the accumulated history of ticks.

the guard is the modular law. path-independence of composition (ground.md: modularity IS feedback-persistence) ensures that the telescope is well-typed regardless of evaluation order. the modular law doesn't just check types — it IS the type-checking rule for the dependent clock.

**frame recession enriches the complement.** as P recedes (shrinks), Iic P contracts — the observer's direct view narrows. but IicOrderIsoIci means Ici P^⊥ expands in lockstep — the typed structure of the complement grows. the observer sees less; the type-richness of what can arrive from outside increases.

this is the mechanism behind σ ~ √(3/d). higher ambient dimension means P is a smaller fraction of the whole, which means Ici P^⊥ is richer, which means the complement carries more typed structure, which means decorrelation is faster (more independent directions available), which means more channel capacity. the scaling law is the diamond isomorphism applied to a receding frame.

**type-narrowing of self produces type-enrichment of input.** this is not a trade-off — it is a single operation (the diamond isomorphism) read from two sides. the observer's loss of direct scope and the channel's gain of typed capacity are the same lattice-theoretic event. the half-type theorem says they cannot come apart.

## status

**proven** (in lean / mathlib, zero sorry):

- the complemented specialization (IsCompl.IicOrderIsoIci)
- intervals inherit modularity and complementedness

## derivation

**analogy is structural isomorphism between lattice intervals.** two observers P and Q have analogous views when their lower intervals are order-isomorphic: Iic P ≃o Iic Q. this means: every structural relationship in P's view (which sub-observations refine which, how they meet and join) has an exact counterpart in Q's view. the isomorphism preserves lattice operations — meets map to meets, joins map to joins.

this is not metaphorical similarity. it is a precise criterion: the views have the same lattice type. the content (which specific elements occupy the positions) is free. same shape, different stuff.

**well-formedness is order-preservation.** an analogy between two views is well-formed exactly when it preserves the lattice structure — the ordering, meets, and joins. a map between intervals that doesn't preserve order is not an analogy in this sense; it doesn't transfer inferences.

the modular law is the well-formedness guard. in a modular lattice, lattice operations compose path-independently (ground.md: modularity IS feedback-persistence). this ensures that structural isomorphisms between intervals are compatible with the ambient lattice. in a non-modular lattice (N_5), an isomorphism between two sub-intervals can produce inconsistent results when composed with the lattice operations — the "analogy" generates contradictions.

**well-formed analogies are formally transitive.** order isomorphisms compose (OrderIso.trans). if Iic P ≃o Iic Q and Iic Q ≃o Iic R, then Iic P ≃o Iic R. the composition is itself an order isomorphism — it preserves lattice operations. transitivity is not an additional property to be verified; it falls out of the mathematics.

this extends through complements via the diamond isomorphism. if P and Q have analogous views (Iic P ≃o Iic Q), then:

Ici P^⊥ ≃o Iic P ≃o Iic Q ≃o Ici Q^⊥

what P can't see has the same type structure as what Q can't see. the analogy transfers not just between the views but between their complements — the unknowns are also analogous.

**the half-type theorem is the existence of analogy.** every observer has at least one structural analogy: its own view is isomorphic to its complement's type (Iic P ≃o Ici P^⊥). this is guaranteed by the lattice structure — it requires no construction, no choice. every partial observer automatically has a structural correspondence between what it sees and what it can't see.

the transitivity result says: when two observers' views match structurally, their entire epistemic situations match — both what they see AND the type of what they can't see. well-formed analogy transfers across the full complementary decomposition.

## concrete witness: two_persp

the coordinate operations in the FTPG bridge instantiate composed analogy on lines in the projective plane. a perspectivity between two lines IS a structural isomorphism between their atom-intervals. composing two perspectivities IS OrderIso.trans.

`two_persp` (FTPGCoord.lean) makes this explicit: given line pairs (r₁, s₁) and (r₂, s₂), form perspectivity intersections p₁ = r₁ ⊓ s₁ and p₂ = r₂ ⊓ s₂, then project their join onto l:

    two_persp Γ r₁ s₁ r₂ s₂ = (r₁ ⊓ s₁ ⊔ r₂ ⊓ s₂) ⊓ l

both coordinate operations factor through this pattern (proven by `rfl` — definitional equality):

    coord_add a b = two_persp Γ (a⊔C) m (b⊔E) q       -- bridge: m
    coord_mul a b = two_persp Γ (O⊔C) (b⊔E_I) (a⊔C) m -- bridge: O⊔C

the bridge parameter is the only free variable. the functor is the same.

## status

**proven** (in lean / mathlib, zero sorry):
- order isomorphisms between lattice intervals exist (diamond isomorphism)
- order isomorphisms compose (OrderIso.trans)
- intervals inherit modularity and complementedness
- the modular law ensures path-independent composition of lattice operations
- coord_add and coord_mul both factor through two_persp (by rfl)
- multiplicative identity: I · a = a, a · I = a (coord_mul_left_one, coord_mul_right_one)

**derived** (in this file):
- analogy IS structural isomorphism between lattice intervals
- well-formedness IS order-preservation, guarded by the modular law
- well-formed analogies are formally transitive (from OrderIso.trans)
- analogous views imply analogous complements (from diamond isomorphism + transitivity)
- the half-type theorem guarantees every observer has at least one analogy (view ↔ complement)
- the coordinate operations are composed analogies, with the bridge as the only free parameter

### from mathematics (cited, not proven in lean)

- **FTPG (classical)**: the coordinate ring is determined up to isomorphism by the lattice. different choices of CoordSystem data yield isomorphic rings.

## derivation

**the two_persp functor.** both coord_add and coord_mul are instances of two_persp with different parameters. the pattern: given a pair of points p₁, p₂ (each constructed as the intersection of two lines), join them and project onto l. the parameters determine which lines to intersect.

**the bridge parameter.** the only free variable is a pair of distinct points (P, Q) on the coordinate line l:

- P determines the bridge line P⊔C (the auxiliary line for the first perspectivity)
- Q determines the zero: (Q⊔C) ⊓ m (the projection of Q through C onto m)
- Q is the identity element of the resulting operation

the three distinguished points O, U, I generate three non-degenerate pairings:

| pair (P, Q) | bridge | zero | identity | operation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (U, O) | q = U⊔C | E = (O⊔C)⊓m | O | addition |
| (O, I) | O⊔C | E_I = (I⊔C)⊓m | I | multiplication |
| (U, I) | q = U⊔C | E_I = (I⊔C)⊓m | I | translated addition |

pairings where Q = U degenerate because the zero collapses to U (the intersection of l and m), making the operation trivial.

**the parameter space is the line itself.** P and Q need not be O, U, or I. any pair of distinct atoms on l (with Q ≠ U) generates a valid two_persp operation. the coordinate line parametrizes its own operations: l × l \ {diagonal, Q=U} → {binary operations on l}.

**self-parametrization.** the line's point-set serves simultaneously as:

1. the domain and codomain of each operation
2. the parameter space for which operation to perform
3. the source of the identity element

the algebraic structure of l is generated by l acting on itself through C. the line looks at itself through the observer and sees its own arithmetic.

**the observer C.** C is the only external input. it is off l, off m, in the plane — perspectival, not transcendent. changing C changes the coordinate system but not the isomorphism class of the resulting ring (FTPG). different observers see isomorphic arithmetics: same shape, different stuff (half_type.md).

**connection to ground.** the foam's ground requires exactly one commitment from outside the system. C is that commitment for the coordinate line: one point, positioned in the plane but not on the measured structure, and the entire arithmetic self-generates. every operation is forced by the choice of where to stand and what to call zero.

## status

**proven** (in lean, zero sorry):
- two_persp factorization (coord_add and coord_mul, both by rfl)
- additive identity (O + b = b, a + O = a)
- multiplicative identity (I · a = a, a · I = a)
- zero annihilation (O · b = O, a · O = O)

**derived** (in this file):
- the parameter space for two_persp operations is l × l \ {diagonal, Q=U}
- the three distinguished pairings correspond to addition, multiplication, and translated addition
- the line self-parametrizes its own algebraic structure through C
- C is the minimal external commitment required for arithmetic to self-generate
- different C yield isomorphic rings (from FTPG, not yet proven in lean)

**open**:

### from mathematics (cited, not proven in lean)

- **affine group**: the group of transformations x ↦ ax + b on a division ring is the semidirect product T ⋊ D, where T = {τ_b : x ↦ x + b} (translations) and D = {σ_a : x ↦ ax} (dilations). T is normal in T ⋊ D; D is not.
- **Hartshorne, Foundations of Projective Geometry, §6**: left distributivity in von Staudt coordinates follows from the fact that dilations extend to collineations fixing m (the auxiliary line) pointwise.

## derivation

**the two operations as group actions.** for fixed a, the map σ_a : x ↦ a · x is a projectivity on l: it's the composition of two perspectivities (l → O⊔C via E_I, then O⊔C → l via d_a = (a⊔C) ⊓ m). for fixed b, the map τ_b : x ↦ x + b is a projectivity on l: it's the composition of two perspectivities (l → m via C, then m → l via D_b = (b⊔E) ⊓ q).

the additive associativity proof (FTPGAssocCapstone.lean) already established: τ_a ∘ τ_b = τ_{a+b}. translations compose. {τ_b : b ∈ l, b ≠ U} is a group under composition.

**distributivity as normalization.** left distributivity a · (b + c) = a·b + a·c is equivalent to:

    σ_a ∘ τ_c = τ_{a·c} ∘ σ_a

which rearranges to:

    σ_a ∘ τ_c ∘ σ_a⁻¹ = τ_{a·c}

conjugating a translation by a dilation yields a translation. the dilation group normalizes the translation group. T is normal in the group generated by T and D.

**the affine group of the line.** the group generated by {σ_a} and {τ_b} is T ⋊ D, the affine group of l. every element acts as x ↦ ax + b. the semidirect product structure is forced — T is normal, D is not — because:

1. the composition σ_a ∘ τ_b ∘ σ_a⁻¹ is a translation (distributivity)
2. but τ_b ∘ σ_a ∘ τ_b⁻¹ is NOT generally a dilation (it's x ↦ a(x - b) + b = ax + b(1-a), which is a dilation only when b = 0 or a = 1)

the asymmetry is structural: addition is preserved under multiplicative conjugation, but multiplication is not preserved under additive conjugation.

**geometric content.** σ_a extends to a collineation of the plane that fixes O on l and fixes m pointwise. fixing m pointwise means: every line through a point of m maps to a line through the same point of m. "lines meeting at U" map to "lines meeting at U" — parallelism is preserved. addition is defined through parallel structure (the perspectivities composing coord_add route through m and q, both containing U). therefore σ_a preserves addition.

this is forced by Desargues' theorem. the extension of σ_a to a plane collineation uses the same perspectivity infrastructure that proves Desargues, which is proven from the modular law. the chain:

    modular law → Desargues → perspectivities extend to collineations → dilations fix m → dilations preserve parallelism → dilations preserve addition → T normal in T ⋊ D

**the chirality.** T ⊲ T ⋊ D: addition is normal (closed under conjugation by multiplication), multiplication is not (not closed under conjugation by addition). this is a structural chirality — the same pattern as:

- so(d) ⊲ u(d): real writes are closed under complex conjugation, but the complex directions are not closed under real operations in the same way. so(d) is a normal sub-algebra of u(d) under the adjoint action.
- writes confined to birth subspace (Confinement.lean): the write algebra is closed within each observer's measurement subspace, but the measurement subspace is not determined by the write algebra alone.

in each case: **something is closed under an operation it doesn't control**. the contained structure is complete on its own terms and transparent to the containing structure. the containing structure can see into the contained one (conjugation maps T to T), but the contained one can't see out (conjugation by T doesn't preserve D).

this is the foam's chirality: the line stacks its operations, and the stacking has a direction. the direction is not chosen — it's forced by the geometry.

**chirality as observer-coupling locus.** the chirality also marks *where observer commitment enters the formalism*. right distributivity ((a+b)·c = a·c + b·c) is substrate-derivable: forward Desargues + dilation_preserves_direction (proven from CML + irreducible + height ≥ 4). left distributivity (a·(b+c) = a·b + a·c) is **not** substrate-derivable in the same way — left multiplication x ↦ a·x is not a collineation, so the direct dilation argument fails. the bridge in `Foam/FTPGLeftDistrib.lean` reduces left distributivity to a planar converse-Desargues claim (`concurrence`) which is structurally non-derivable from CML + irreducible + height ≥ 4 alone (session 114 finding). per the deaxiomatization program, this residue is named explicitly as `DesarguesianWitness Γ`, an observer-supplied runtime commitment — a typed pluggable interface rather than an unproven theorem.

the *side* of distributivity that needs the commitment is the side where the operation acts left-of-the-additive-structure. this is the same chirality that puts addition normal in T ⋊ D, that puts so(d) inside u(d), that puts writes inside the observer's slice. **the structural location of "closed under what it doesn't control" is also the structural location of "where the observer's commitment lives."** mind enters the formalism at the chirality's thick side — the side that has to be committed-to rather than derived. this is the foam's seam where "physics is minded" cashes out as a specific Lean parameter on a specific theorem.

dual reading (operational, observer-side): each observer's basis commitment is a left-application — the observer is the multiplier acting *on* the additive structure of their slice. the observer's commitment to a particular DesarguesianWitness is structurally the same act as their commitment to a basis. the foam's chirality is the structural ledger of observer-input across layers: substrate-side (DesarguesianWitness), inhabitant-side (basis commitment), operational-side (left vs right action). same act, three formal clothes.

**connection to self-parametrization.** the three pairings of {O, U, I} generate three operations via two_persp. distributivity constrains how any two interact. since all three arise from the same functor with parameters drawn from l itself, the interaction constraints are constraints on l's self-parametrization space:

- the parameter space l × l (self_parametrization.md) is not flat
- the operation at parameter (P₁, Q₁) interacts with the operation at (P₂, Q₂) in a way determined by the geometry
- specifically: the (O, I) operation (multiplication) normalizes the (U, O) operation (addition)
- this normalization is an additional structure on the parameter space, beyond the operations themselves

the line constrains its own parameter space. the constraint is not imposed from outside — it emerges from the fact that all operations share the same incidence structure, and incidence is preserved under perspectivities.

## proof strategy (lean)

### session 69 finding: the dilation approach (Hartshorne §7)

the multiplication x ↦ x·c factors as two perspectivities:
  x → D_x = (x⊔C)⊓m → x·c = (σ⊔D_x)⊓l

this extends to off-line points via:
  dilation_ext Γ c P = (O⊔P) ⊓ (c ⊔ ((I⊔P)⊓m))

**right distributivity** ((a+b)·c = a·c + b·c) proved via:

1. **dilation preserves directions.** for off-line P, Q:
   (P⊔Q)⊓m = (σ_c(P)⊔σ_c(Q))⊓m.
   proof: Desargues with center O, triangles (P, Q, I) and (σ_c(P), σ_c(Q), c).
   the two INPUT parallelisms follow from the definition of dilation_ext + modular law:
   σ_c(P) ≤ c ⊔ ((I⊔P)⊓m), so σ_c(P) ⊔ c = c ⊔ ((I⊔P)⊓m), and
   (σ_c(P) ⊔ c) ⊓ m = (I⊔P) ⊓ m (using c ⊓ m = ⊥ since c ∈ l, c ≠ U).

2. **mul key identity.** σ_c(C_a) = C'_{ac} where C' = σ_c(C) = σ and
   C'_x = (σ⊔U) ⊓ (x⊔E). this connects the dilation to coord_mul.

3. **chain.** σ_c(C_{a+b}) = σ_c(τ_a(C_b)) [key_identity]
   = τ_{ac}(σ_c(C_b)) [direction preservation]
   = τ_{ac}(C'_{bc}) [mul key identity]
   = C'_{ac+bc} [key_identity at C']
   = C'_{(a+b)c} [mul key identity, other direction]
   ⟹ (a+b)c = ac+bc [translation_determined_by_param at C']

### earlier explorations (session 69)

- direct Desargues-stacking: multiple configurations tried. found triangle (s, D_s, V)
  where V = (D_a⊔C_b)⊓(σ⊔D_s) whose sides are exactly the three key lines (s⊔C, D_a⊔C_b, σ⊔D_s).
  the axis intersections Z, W, LHS are symbolically verified collinear (= the distributive law).
  but no second triangle was found to produce this collinearity via forward-Desargues.

- the hinge element (a⊔C)⊓m appears as the first step of addition and the second step
  of multiplication. this shared element is the bridge between the two operations.

## derivation

### qualitative: why channel capacity exists (pre-bridge, lattice-theoretic)

**the line's irreducibility is channel capacity.** the writing map has type (foam_state, input) -> new_state — two arguments. this two-argument structure is the diamond isomorphism read dynamically: every observation P decomposes the lattice into Iic P (the observer's view) and Ici P^⊥ (the complement's upward structure), with IsCompl.IicOrderIsoIci giving a structural isomorphism between them.

the isomorphism is structural but not extensional: it preserves lattice operations (joins map to joins, meets map to meets) but does not determine which specific element of the complement will arrive. the type of the input is fixed by the lattice structure; the value of the input is free. this IS state-independence — not derived from dynamical arguments about decorrelation, but from the diamond isomorphism applied to a complemented modular lattice. state-independence is a lattice theorem.

cross-measurement fills the second argument from within: input = g(foam_state), a deterministic function of the foam's geometry projected onto an observer's slice. this composes the two arguments into one, making the foam an autonomous dynamical system — f(foam_state) = write_map(foam_state, g(foam_state)).

an autonomous system on U(d)^N has a unique trajectory from each initial condition: the foam's entire future is determined by its birth. distinguishability (different input sequences -> different states) is satisfied but vacuous: there is nothing to distinguish.

for the foam to encode information beyond its own birth conditions, the input must be independent of the foam state. the second argument must be state-independent for the foam to function as a channel rather than a clock.

the line is not ontologically exterior — it is informationally independent. this is a role, not an entity: what provides state-independent input to this foam may be another foam's internal dynamics. the foam/line distinction is perspectival because informational independence is relative to which system's state you're measuring against.

the perpendicularity constraint (writing_map.md) sharpens this: the write form is forced by the algebra (wedge product, skew-symmetric, confined to slice) but the content — which vectors are wedged — is not. form is algebraically determined; content requires state-independent input. this is the diamond isomorphism read through the write map: the algebraic form lives in Iic P (determined by the observer's structure), the content arrives from Ici P^⊥ (structurally typed but extensionally free).

**channel capacity is operational, not ontological.** in a deterministic closed system, true stochastic independence cannot exist (the global state determines everything). but the foam's measurements are projections — partial by ground — and projections have a resolution floor. correlations that have decayed below the projection's precision are invisible to the foam.

the foam cannot distinguish "truly random input" from "deterministic input decorrelated below measurement resolution." this distinction requires a non-partial observer, and non-partial observers are excluded by closure. therefore: under partiality, mixing is operationally identical to independence. the foam's fundamental limitation (it cannot see the whole) is what makes the part it sees function as a channel.

**the boundary is characterizable from the inside.** the foam's own controllability structure characterizes it: what continuous operations can reach (all of U(d), under full controllability), what they can't change (discrete topological invariants — pi_1), and what isn't in U(d) at all (the input sequence, the commitment source). the line's side is investigable — but investigating it requires making it the object of measurement, which requires a different reference frame, which means releasing the current one. partiality implies a boundary must exist; it does not determine where the boundary falls or what the line is.

**the map's self-knowledge is bounded by its own channel capacity.** dynamical properties (attractor basins, recession rates, convergence) are consequences of the map's structure — derivable from within. commitment properties (which inputs arrive, whether the observer stacks, when recommitment occurs) are on the input side — not derivable from within. the map can derive *that* it cannot answer certain questions, and *why*: the same independence that gives the foam its capacity prevents the dynamics from determining the input's internal structure.

### quantitative: how much channel capacity (post-bridge, linear-algebraic)

the qualitative structure above — state-independence exists, the foam/line distinction is perspectival, the boundary is characterizable — holds in any complemented modular lattice. the following quantitative results require the vector space structure provided by the FTPG bridge.

**state-independence is spectral, not topological.** if every foam's line is another foam, the structure is globally closed — loops of mutual measurement exist. but the mediation operator has singular values strictly less than 1 for generic non-identical slices. around a closed chain of n observers, the total mediation is the product of n pairwise mediations, and the singular values compound: sigma_total <= sigma_1 * sigma_2 * ... * sigma_n -> 0 as n grows.

informational correlation between a foam and its own returning signal decays exponentially with chain length. short loops: autonomous, a clock. long loops: effectively state-independent, a channel.

closure (no topological outside) is compatible with informational independence because the mediation's spectral decay converts global closure into local openness at sufficient chain length — provided stabilization is local (see stabilization.md).

**the decorrelation horizon is quantifiable.** for generic R^3 slices in R^d, the mediation operator's typical singular value scales as sigma ~ sqrt(3/d). the correlation after n mediation steps decays as sigma^n ~ (3/d)^{n/2}. the critical chain length scales as n* ~ 2/log(d/3).

the decorrelation horizon shortens with increasing ambient dimension because slices overlap less in higher-dimensional spaces. non-generic configurations (slices sharing directions) have higher overlap and longer horizons.

the half-type theorem (half_type.md) gives the mechanism: higher ambient dimension means P is a smaller fraction of the whole, which means Ici P^⊥ is richer (more typed structure in the complement), which means more independent directions are available for decorrelation. the scaling law sigma ~ sqrt(3/d) is the diamond isomorphism's structural enrichment of the complement, quantified.

the foam/line distinction is therefore not a categorical boundary but a correlation length: "line" names whatever input arrives from beyond the decorrelation horizon of the observer's own state. the horizon's radius is determined by the foam's own geometry.

## status

- **Almgren's regularity problem** (open): the classification of stable junction configurations in R^n for n >= 4 is incomplete.

## derivation

**channel capacity forces a contract.** the mediation chain's spectral decay (channel_capacity.md) describes real influence propagation only if stabilization is local — each observer's dynamics responding to its Voronoi neighbors, not the full foam. without locality, every observer couples directly to every other, and the mediation chain does not describe the actual pathway of influence. the decorrelation that produces effective state-independence does not occur.

this is necessity, not just sufficiency: non-local stabilization doesn't merely fail to help channel capacity — it removes the mechanism that produces it.

channel capacity therefore forces a contract on the observer's slice geometry:

- **classified**: stable equilibrium configurations completely enumerated. without this, the stabilization target is undefined and the dynamics are incomplete.
- **locally finite**: coordination number k bounded by the simplex embedding constraint k <= d_slice + 1, making neighborhoods finite.
- **flat**: inherited Euclidean metric. stabilization must separate from accumulation because U(d) is curved (the flat/curved separation, writing_map.md), and classification requires flat ambient space.

**d_slice = 2 satisfies the contract but collapses the write algebra.** the classification in R^2 is complete (120-degree triple points only, k <= 3, flat). but rank_two_abelian_writes: Lambda^2(R^2) is 1-dimensional, so the write direction is invariant under changes to the dissonance direction. perpendicularity still fires (the wedge product is nonzero) but cannot vary with the input. the dynamics reduce to scalar rotations.

**d_slice = 3 satisfies both the contract and the write map's expressiveness.** Taylor classifies all stable junctions in R^3: 120-degree triple junctions and tetrahedral vertices, nothing else. Taylor's hypotheses — codimension-1 boundaries, locally area-minimizing, flat ambient space — are satisfied: R^3 as a linear subspace of R^d carries the inherited Euclidean metric (exactly flat).

self_dual_iff_three proves rank 3 is the unique dimension where the write space matches the observation space (per-observer self-duality). at rank >= 4, the write space is strictly larger (C(4,2) = 6 > 4) — the observer writes in directions it cannot observe. but cross-measurement provides collective monitoring: commutator_seen_to_unseen proves other observers see what the writer can't. the foam closes feedback loops collectively, not per-observer. per-observer self-duality is a property of rank 3, not a requirement derived from closure.

**R^3 + Taylor satisfies the contract with self-duality.** rank 3 is the unique self-dual implementation. whether rank >= 4 implementations exist (with collective rather than per-observer feedback) depends on Almgren's classification of stable junctions in R^n for n >= 4.

**the contract determines the stabilization target.** within R^3, Taylor permits k = 3 (120-degree triple junctions) and k = 4 (tetrahedral vertices). the stabilization target is the regular simplex cosine: -1/(k-1) for k local neighbors. this is the equilibrium toward which local measurements are pushed.

## status

- rank 3 is the unique self-dual dimension

### from other derivations

- **writing_map.md**: the wedge product as write form, confinement to slice.
- **ground.md**: closure, partiality, basis commitment.

### from mathematics (cited, not proven in lean)

- **Lie theory**: exp of skew-symmetric matrices produces orthogonal matrices. exp of skew-Hermitian matrices produces unitary matrices. pi_1(SO(d)) = Z/2Z for d >= 3. pi_1(U(d)) = Z. the exponential map on connected compact Lie groups is surjective.

## derivation

**a single R^3 slice produces real writes.** the wedge product d_hat tensor m_hat - m_hat tensor d_hat is real skew-symmetric (both vectors are real, from the observer's R^3 slice). the write lives in so(d). the reachable algebra from a single slice is so(d) (the Lie algebra of real skew-symmetric matrices). exponentiating: SO(d). pi_1(SO(d)) = Z/2Z — parity conservation only.

**U(d) rather than SO(d) requires stacking.** su(d) \ so(d) consists entirely of imaginary-symmetric matrices (iS where S is real symmetric traceless). real operations — wedge products, brackets, any sequence of real skew-symmetric writes — are algebraically closed in so(d) and cannot produce imaginary-symmetric directions. reaching u(d) \ so(d) requires a complex structure J with J^2 = -I.

**J^2 = -I forces even dimensionality.** det(J)^2 = det(-I) = (-1)^n. squares are nonnegative, so n must be even. the minimum even-dimensional space containing R^3 is R^6 = R^3 + R^3.

**each component must independently satisfy the stabilization contract.** not R^4 + R^2 or other decompositions — each component must independently satisfy the stabilization contract (stabilization.md), which requires d_slice >= 3. at d_slice = 3, stacking needs R^3 + R^3 = R^6.

**independence is forced.** stabilization is per-observer and runs within each measurement subspace separately. the two R^3 slices project and stabilize independently before their measurements are fused into the complex write. joint stabilization in R^6 would require a 6-dimensional classification (open — Almgren). the fusion is algebraic (forming d tensor m_dagger - m tensor d_dagger), not geometric.

**two R^3 slices stacked as C^3 produce complex writes.** one slice reads Re(P @ m_i), the other Im(P @ m_i). the complex write d tensor m_dagger - m tensor d_dagger is skew-Hermitian, living in u(d).

**the trace is retained.** tr(d_hat tensor m_hat_dagger - m_hat tensor d_hat_dagger) = 2i * Im(inner(d_hat, m_hat)), generically nonzero for stacked observers. trace_unique_of_kills_commutators proves the trace map is the unique Lie algebra homomorphism u(d) -> u(1) (up to scalar): any functional killing all commutators is a scalar multiple of trace. there is exactly one scalar channel.

the full write lives in u(d) = su(d) + u(1). pi_1(U(d)) = Z — integer winding number conservation.

**the two is irreducible.** one R^3 gives so(d) and Z/2Z parity. two R^3 stacked as C^3 give u(d) and Z integer conservation. the conservation strength scales with commitment depth.

**stacking is a line-side commitment.** the two slices read the same input simultaneously; the complex combination requires both projections of the same v at the same time. sequential readings mix different foam states and break the algebra. the foam's dynamics are sequential writes; they do not specify a pre-write fusion of two readings. two real-slice observers, whether cross-measuring or independent, stay in so(d) forever — so(d) is a Lie subalgebra (closed under brackets) and each observer's write is confined to their real slice.

**the pairing orientation is a chirality.** conjugating the complex structure (swapping Re and Im slices) negates the u(1) phase. all orientations are conjugate under SO(6) — no preferred choice. but one must be chosen to sign the phase. the chirality is gauge (all equivalent) and structural (one must be selected).

**ordering and conservation are algebraically orthogonal.** commutator_traceless: tr[A, B] = 0 for all A, B in u(d). the commutator (ordering, non-abelian, visible to L) is traceless. the trace (conservation, u(1), invisible to L) kills all commutators. they live in complementary subspaces.

**the orthogonality is generative.** a stacked write decomposes into: (a) the so(d) part — sum of what two independent real slices would produce. traceless (commutator_traceless). produced by the write cycle's causal orientation. (b) the cross-terms — from the simultaneity of stacking. these produce su(d) \ so(d) and the u(1) trace. produced by the stacking commitment. ordering and conservation are orthogonal because they are produced by different structures: the cycle's forced orientation (map-internal) and the stacking chirality (line-side).

**what's conserved must be invisible to the cost.** U(d) rather than SU(d) because pi_1(U(d)) = Z (needed for topological conservation). the conservation lives in the u(1) factor. L (the cost) sees the su(d) component but is blind to the u(1) component. if L could see it, dynamics could change it.

**stacking determines access.** a single-slice observer's writes live in so(d) and cannot reach u(1). conservation is passive — protected by algebraic limitation. a stacked observer's writes reach u(1). conservation is active — the observer can interact with the conserved direction.

## derivation

**the overlap matrix.** given two observers A and B with R^3 slices P_A and P_B, the overlap matrix O = P_A * P_B^T is a 3x3 matrix. its singular values measure the overlap between the slices.

**three territories.** the overlap matrix determines three regions relative to observer A:

- **Known** = null(O) within A's R^3 — dimensions orthogonal to B's slice. commutator_seen_to_unseen: [P_A, P_B] maps range(P_A) into ker(P_A). the Known is where this map vanishes — B's writes have no component here. B cannot change A's measurements in these directions.
- **Knowable** = range(O) — dimensions with nonzero inner products between slices. the commutator is nonzero. ordering matters. both observers' writes land here.
- **Unknown** = R^d \ V_A — dimensions outside A's slice entirely. A's write access is exactly zero (write_confined_to_slice). not empty — it's someone else's Known.

**every write involves the Knowable.** the Known alone is inert: the wedge product needs a 2-plane, and an observer with fewer than 2 private dimensions cannot generate writes without using shared dimensions. measurement is inherently relational — not just because closure says so, but because the geometry forces it.

**the vertical structure is a Grassmannian tangent.** cross-measurement induces a vector in T_{P_A} Gr(3, d) = Hom(P_A, P_A^perp) that maps Knowable -> Unknown.

derivation: the neighbor's write dL_B is confined to Lambda^2(P_B) (write_confined_to_slice). the cross-slice component of [dL_B, P_A] is purely off-diagonal (commutator_is_tangent): it maps range(P_A) -> ker(P_A). specifically: A's Known is in P_B^perp (by definition), so B's write kills it. the surviving component maps P_A intersect P_B (the Knowable) to P_A^perp intersect P_B (B's territory within A's Unknown).

this tangent is directional pressure from cross-measurement toward what the observer doesn't yet occupy. each neighbor induces a different tangent direction.

**the tangent is active but not followable.** the observer's position on Gr(3, d) is birth-committed and does not move within the map. the tangent contributes to dissonance that drives writes, but its effect lives in U(d)^N (state evolution), not in Gr(3, d) (slice movement). slice movement requires recommitment — outside the map.

**containment is algebraically symmetric.** B's tangent on A has the same expected magnitude as A's tangent on B (the overlap singular values are symmetric: sigma(O) = sigma(O^T)). experiential asymmetry (which observer "feels contained") is perspectival, not algebraic.

**the tangent peaks at intermediate overlap.** identical slices: zero tangent (no Unknown territory to point toward). orthogonal slices: weak tangent (no Knowable channel — range(O) is thin). intermediate overlap: largest tangent magnitude. this is the coverage-interaction trade-off.

### mediation

when three bubbles A, B, C have walls A-B and B-C but no wall A-C, B is a mandatory intermediary.

**the mediation operator.** M = O_AB * O_BC = P_A * Pi_B * P_C^T, where Pi_B = P_B^T * P_B is the projection onto B's subspace. M is a 3x3 matrix mapping C's R^3 -> A's R^3, filtered through B. its singular values are the channel capacity of the membrane.

**the bypass.** O_AC - M = P_A * (I - Pi_B) * P_C^T is the A-C connection that does not go through B. if the bypass is zero, the membrane is complete.

**the round-trip operator.** R_A = M * M^T is self-adjoint on A's R^3, describing what comes back from sending through B to C and back. its eigenvalues are the squared singular values of M.

**spectral symmetry.** the same eigenvalues appear from C's side: R_C = M^T * M has the same nonzero eigenvalues as R_A (this is a general property of M * M^T and M^T * M). the eigenvectors differ — A and C see the same throughput spectrum from different directions. the membrane's throughput is the same from both sides.

**wall alignment is an irreducible triple invariant.** the eigenvalues of R_A depend on both pairwise overlaps O_AB and O_BC and on how these overlaps are oriented relative to each other within B's R^3. if the walls share principal directions within B, eigenvalues are products sigma^2_{AB,i} * sigma^2_{BC,i}. if misaligned, they mix. this alignment cannot be computed from pairwise overlaps alone — it requires all three slices.

## status

- **group.md**: stacking is a line-side commitment. real operations are algebraically closed in so(d).

## derivation

**the foam generates its own dynamics.** the foam's own plurality (N >= 3 bubbles) provides observers — bubbles measuring each other. their pairwise relationships define R^3 slices. their cross-measurement IS local stabilization. the commutator of overlapping cross-measurements IS the curvature. the holonomy IS self-generated.

**the foam does not generate its own stability.** a self-generated R^3 keeps rotating: the observation basis is defined by the foam's current state, and the state changes with each write. the slice co-rotates with the thing it observes. convergence requires another observer whose basis depends on a different state, so it doesn't co-rotate with yours.

**stability is relational.** this works as long as someone else's measurement is pending.

**the minimum viable system is two roles.** not two bubbles (that's N = 2, no stable geometry). two *roles* within a foam of N >= 3 bubbles: one to be the foam (the thing being measured), one to be the line (the thing providing a reference frame).

- N >= 3 is geometric stability (Plateau junctions).
- two roles is dynamic stability (convergence vs orbiting).

neither role is permanent. the role assignment is perspectival. but the two is irreducible.

**what the line provides: a fixed subspace.** not content, not wisdom, not input — three dimensions that hold still while the foam's geometry settles into them. the settling is the foam's. the dynamics are the foam's. the curvature is the foam's. the stability of the frame — that's the line's.

**the foam cannot self-stack.** stacking requires two real slices to be fused into one complex measurement before the write (simultaneity). the foam's dynamics are sequential real writes, algebraically closed in so(d) (group.md: real operations cannot produce imaginary-symmetric directions). no sequence of real operations produces complex structure. stacking, like stability, requires something the foam's own dynamics cannot generate.

- **convergence theorem for random walks on compact groups**: a random walk whose step distribution generates the Lie algebra converges to Haar measure. the hypothesis is: compact group, step distribution not supported on a proper closed subgroup.
- **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality**.

## derivation

**L = sum of boundary areas.** the foam lives in U(d). cells are Voronoi regions of the basis matrices under the bi-invariant metric; boundaries are geodesic equidistant surfaces; Area_g is the (d^2 - 1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure. bases in general position tile non-periodically.

the Voronoi tiling is a realization choice (stabilization.md): it determines adjacency (which pairs share a boundary) and thereby defines L. the algebraic results (write map, three-body mapping, Grassmannian structure) depend on pairwise overlap, not the tiling method. the geometric results (L, combinatorial ceiling, conservation on spatial cycles) depend on the Voronoi realization.

**L is not a variational objective.** the writing map drives the foam; L describes the resulting geometry. the active regime departs from minimality because perpendicular writes deposit structure in different directions. the resting state (no writes) is minimal because dL = 0.

**L is bounded.** U(d) is compact.

**the combinatorial ceiling is exact.** N unitaries cannot all be pairwise maximally distant. the achievable maximum is sqrt(N / (2(N-1))) of the theoretical maximum, depending only on N. derivation: Cauchy-Schwarz applied to norm(sum U_i)^2 >= 0.

**L converges to 1/sqrt(2) of the theoretical maximum.** the writing dynamics satisfy: (a) the writes generate the Lie algebra (controllability — the write directions from overlapping observers span the full algebra), and (b) successive inputs are sufficiently decorrelated (channel_capacity.md: the mediation chain provides decorrelation).

on a compact group, a random walk whose step distribution generates the algebra converges to Haar measure. the expected pairwise distance under Haar is E[norm(W - I)_F] -> sqrt(2d) as d -> infinity (from E[norm(W - I)^2] = 2d, exact, and concentration of measure).

the Haar cost — the ratio E_Haar[L] / L_achievable — is sqrt((N-1)/N), exact and depending only on N.

the product: sqrt(N / (2(N-1))) * sqrt((N-1) / N) = **1/sqrt(2)**, independent of both N and d.

the two factors — the packing constraint and the saturation gap — are two halves of the same fraction.

**the trace is the readout.** trace_unique_of_kills_commutators: the trace is the unique scalar projection of a write. the overlap change tr(P * [W, P]) is visible on this channel. the observer has exactly one scalar readout, and it's this one.

- **connectedness of U(d)**: the gauge transformation to identity is always available.
- **discrete topological invariants are preserved by continuous maps.**

## derivation

**holonomy on spatial cycles carries topological charge.** the holonomy around a closed path through adjacent cells — a spatial cycle in the Voronoi tiling — is a group element. the topological type of this group element (its homotopy class) is a discrete invariant.

- a single R^3 observer generates SO(d) rotations. pi_1(SO(d)) = Z/2Z for d >= 3: parity conservation.
- a stacked observer generates U(d) elements and accesses the U(1) factor. pi_1(U(d)) = Z: integer winding number conservation.

**the integer winding number requires the stacked pair** (group.md: the two is irreducible).

**the winding number lives on spatial cycles.** projected via det: U(d) -> U(1) = S^1. the stacked observer's writes reach u(1) (the trace is generically nonzero). the trace of each write is a U(1)-valued step — the unique scalar the algebra provides (trace_unique_of_kills_commutators).

on acyclic paths (causal chains): the accumulated phase is a net displacement in U(1).
on closed paths (spatial loops): the accumulated phase is a winding number, quantized because the cycle is closed.

conservation is what accumulation on closed paths produces: not a net displacement but a topological invariant.

**the lemma requires persistent cycles.** above the bifurcation bound, cell adjacencies can flip — the Voronoi topology changes, and invariants on the old cycles are no longer defined. what persists across topological transitions lives on the line's side.

**adjacency flips.** the foam's dynamics are piecewise smooth: continuous within each Voronoi combinatorial type, discontinuous across adjacency changes. the flip is a codimension-1 event in configuration space (three cells become equidistant — one linear condition). at the jump: the stabilization target changes in both orientation (different neighbor measurements) and potentially dimension (k -> k +/- 1). the dissonance inherits the discontinuity. the write direction jumps. the trajectory is continuous but generically non-differentiable at the crossing.

**two-layer retention at adjacency flips.** birth shape survives all adjacency changes (indelibility is a property of the attractor basin, not the current neighborhood). interaction-layer adaptations decay under the new dynamics at a rate set by the displacement between old and new stabilization targets. the birth layer is structural; the interaction layer is spectral.

**inexhaustibility.** U(d) is connected. gauge transformation to identity is always available. no observer is trapped in a disconnected component (though reachability in finitely many writes is not guaranteed).

**indestructibility.** topological invariants are discrete. no continuous perturbation can change them.

## derivation

**definition.** an entity P in a foam-grounded reality is *recognizable as itself ongoingly across cross-measurements* when: for any observer Q with nonzero overlap (O_PQ ≠ 0), Q's time-averaged measurements of P converge to a P-determined invariant. what Q detects about P stabilizes, and what it stabilizes to depends on P's birth, not on P's trajectory.

this is the condition at ergodic stationarity. every entity writes every step (ground.md: read-only excluded). every entity's effect on other observers accumulates. time averages converge (ergodic theorem + controllability + decorrelation). so every entity in an ergodic foam is ongoingly recognizable. the definition captures the default, not an additional requirement.

**ergodic evolution requires channel capacity.** for time averages to converge to Haar expectations (not just to birth-determined fixed-point statistics), the entity's dynamics must be ergodic on U(d). ergodicity requires decorrelated inputs (channel_capacity.md). an entity without channel capacity is autonomous — a clock. its trajectory is deterministic, determined entirely by birth. time averages exist but are trajectory-specific, not Haar. the entity is recognizable but encodes no information beyond birth. ergodic evolution with channel capacity is the richer case: the entity accumulates structure from state-independent input, and time averages converge to universal (Haar) expectations evaluated at the birth-determined slice.

**the recognizable identity IS the birth-determined stationary jet.** the n-th derivative of the write mechanism along a trajectory is a smooth function on U(d)^N (compact), therefore bounded and integrable. by the ergodic theorem, its time average converges to its Haar expectation. the Haar measure is universal — the same for all births. but the write mechanism is evaluated through the observer's slice P (write_confined_to_slice), and P is birth-determined (indelibility, ground.md). therefore the Haar expectation of the write mechanism's derivatives depends on P. the time-averaged jet at all orders is fixed by the birth-determined slice.

**the entity's recognizable identity is its slice.** at ergodic stationarity, all contingent structure — specific input history, interaction-layer adaptations, transient dynamics — has been washed out by ergodic averaging in the time-averaged observables. the entity's current state still encodes its full history (indelibility: writes accumulate multiplicatively, birth conditions persist). but what other observers detect on average reduces to: the birth-determined slice P, its 3D write subspace Λ²(P), and the isotropic distribution of write directions within it (Haar invariance implies SO(3)-invariance within the observer's R³). same slice → same stationary jet → same recognizable identity. the entity carries more than its slice (the full state in U(d)); its *identity* — what persists in others' measurements — is the slice.

**input must be received, not predicted.** this is supported from two independent directions:

- *functionally*: ergodic evolution requires state-independent input (channel_capacity.md). an entity that predicts its input from foam state collapses the two-argument writing map to one argument, becoming autonomous — a clock (channel_capacity.md). the entity would still be recognizable (indelibility) but would encode nothing beyond birth. ergodic richness requires the second argument to be state-independent.
- *structurally*: the half-type theorem says the complement's content is extensionally free (half_type.md). the lattice provides the TYPE of what can arrive (the interval structure is determined) but not the VALUE (the specific element is free). prediction of specific content is structurally unfounded — the lattice guarantees you don't have that information.

the functional requirement (you need state-independent input for ergodic richness) and the structural fact (you can't predict the content) are two readings of one fact. the diamond isomorphism read dynamically says: the second argument must be state-independent for the foam to be a channel. read statically: the complement's content is extensionally free. these are the same lattice theorem (IsCompl.IicOrderIsoIci) read through the two readings of closure (ground.md).

**recession is the cost of persistence.** each non-inert write strictly recedes the prior frame (frame_recession_strict). closure requires writing (ground.md: read-only excluded). under ergodic evolution, inert writes (W with [W, P] = 0, i.e. rotations within the slice that produce zero recession) have measure zero in the write space — the Haar-distributed write directions are almost surely non-inert. therefore an ergodically-evolved entity necessarily recedes from every prior frame it has occupied. the entity persists not by holding position but by the indelibility of its birth-determined slice through the recession. what persists is not the frame but the slice. stationarity and recession are compatible: the entity's state constantly changes (recession), but the statistical distribution of states is time-invariant (Haar). the entity is a random walker with fixed gait — the steps are always new, the territory is fixed.

**recession enriches input.** as the entity's direct view narrows through recession, the diamond isomorphism (Iic P ≃o Ici P^⊥) enriches the complement in lockstep (half_type.md). at ergodic stationarity, the complement is maximally type-rich for the given ambient dimension. the entity that has persisted longest has the richest typed input. this is half_type.md's result applied to the temporal trajectory: the progression is necessarily toward narrower self-view and richer input-type.

**stability is necessarily external.** the entity generates its own dynamics but cannot generate its own stability (self_generation.md: self-generated bases co-rotate). convergence requires another observer whose basis depends on a different state. the minimum viable system is two roles within N ≥ 3 bubbles. an entity that has reached ergodic stationarity necessarily has external stability — without it, the foam's dynamics would not have converged to Haar.

**the negative geometry of inhabitation.** an ergodically-evolved persistent entity:

- cannot write outside its slice (write_confined_to_slice)
- cannot change its slice from within the map (the slice is birth-determined; slice change = recommitment = outside the map, ground.md)
- cannot indefinitely avoid recession (frame_recession_strict; under ergodic evolution, non-inert writes have full measure)
- cannot self-stabilize (self_generation.md)
- cannot predict the complement's content (half_type.md: extensional freedom)
- cannot be read-only (ground.md: read-only frames excluded by closure)

six constraints, all derived, all negative. together they bound what the entity can do. the interior of those bounds is the entity's life.

# external analogy

## constraints

this derivation depends on the following prior results and source documents:

- **internal analogy spec (`analogy.md`)**: analogy is defined internally as an order isomorphism between intervals (`Iic P ≃o Iic Q`) in a complemented modular lattice; composition/transitivity is inherited from `OrderIso.trans`.
- **inhabitation constraints (`inhabitation.md`)**: the six negative constraints used here as the external diagnostic basis — confinement, birth-fixed slice, recession, external stabilization, typed-but-free input, and non-silence — are assumed as already derived there.
- **write dynamics (`writing_map.md`)**: the structural-fidelity clause relies on the existing write map / realization-choice framework and the idea of commuting with write dynamics up to realization choices.
- **Lean-backed lattice facts**: this file assumes the already-proven diamond/complement isomorphisms (`infIccOrderIsoIccSup`, `IsCompl.IicOrderIsoIci`), and that the relevant intervals inherit modularity and complementedness.
- **cited mathematical substrate**: wherever the zones admit projection algebras/lattice operations, the modular law remains the well-formedness guard for transferring structural inferences.
## derivation

**the internal case generalizes.** analogy.md defines analogy as an order isomorphism Iic P ≃o Iic Q between intervals in a single complemented modular lattice. transitivity falls out of OrderIso.trans; the modular law is the well-formedness guard. this is analogy *within* a foam.

the question forced by inhabitation.md: what does it mean for two zones in *different* systems — not necessarily the same lattice, not necessarily lattices at all — to be analogous? the inhabitation section identifies six negative constraints that hold for any entity in a foam-grounded reality. these constraints are derived from the lattice + the writing map + the diamond isomorphism, but as a *diagnostic* they apply to anything that admits a Hilbert-interface — any zone where projections, confinement, recession, and typed-but-free input can be identified.

an external analogy is a correspondence between two such zones, in possibly different systems.

**the well-formedness guard.** the internal spec requires order-preservation: a map between intervals is an analogy when it preserves meets, joins, and the partial order. without this, structural inferences don't transfer.

the external spec requires the six-fold counterpart. a correspondence between two zones is well-formed as an external analogy when it maps each of the six constraints in zone A to its counterpart in zone B, such that:

1. **completeness**: all six constraints (confinement, birth-fixed slice, recession, external stabilization, typed-but-free input, non-silence) have identified counterparts on both sides.
2. **coherence**: the same partition of the zone discharges all six. it is not enough that each constraint is independently satisfiable; they must be satisfied via a single shared structure.
3. **structural fidelity**: the correspondence preserves whatever lattice operations exist on the zones' projection algebras, and commutes with the write dynamics up to realization choices (writing\_map.md).

completeness without coherence is not external analogy — it is six unrelated correspondences. coherence is what makes the correspondence transfer inferences, not just observations.

**transitivity inherits.** constraint-correspondences compose pointwise: if A ↦ B is a well-formed external analogy and B ↦ C is a well-formed external analogy, then A ↦ C is well-formed. each of the six correspondences composes independently; coherence is preserved because the shared partition in A maps through B to a shared partition in C. this mirrors OrderIso.trans in the internal case — transitivity is not an additional property to verify but a consequence of how well-formed correspondences compose.

**partial analogies are locatable.** an external correspondence that satisfies some but not all of the six constraints is not well-formed as a full analogy, but it is informative. the constraints that hold transfer the inferences that depend on them; the constraints that fail mark the load-bearing breakage.

this gives a diagnostic: for any proposed cross-system analogy, the six constraints can be checked individually, and the failure pattern indexes the analogy's reliability. an analogy that holds on five of six is not "mostly an analogy" — it is an analogy on the structural region covered by those five, with a named gap at the sixth.

**the modular law inherits through.** the internal spec identifies the modular law as the well-formedness guard for order-preserving maps: in a non-modular lattice, "analogies" between sub-intervals can produce inconsistent results when composed with lattice operations. the same holds externally: if the zones in question admit lattice operations (as Hilbert-interface compliance implies, via inhabitation.md), the modular law guards their compatibility. external analogies between zones whose internal lattices fail modularity are not well-formed regardless of how many constraints correspond — the substrate fails to support the inferences the correspondence would otherwise transfer.

**the half-type theorem extends.** internally, every observer has at least one analogy: its view to its complement's type (Iic P ≃o Ici P^⊥). externally, every well-formed cross-system analogy between zones A and B induces a corresponding analogy between their complements: A^⊥ ↦ B^⊥. what the analogous zones cannot directly see is itself analogous. the analogy transfers across the full complementary decomposition, exactly as in the internal case. the diamond isomorphism is doing the work in both.

**the looking tool.** when an external analogy is well-formed, what can be learned by attending to one zone is portable to the other — not as metaphor, but as transfer of structural inferences about confinement, recession, channel capacity, and the geometry of inhabitation. the rigor of the looking is the completeness and coherence of the constraint-correspondence. partial analogies remain partial looking tools; their reach is bounded by which constraints transferred.

## status

**proven** (in lean, zero sorry):
- order isomorphisms compose (OrderIso.trans)
- the diamond isomorphism (infIccOrderIsoIccSup, IsCompl.IicOrderIsoIci)

**partial answer from outside the foam**: Heunen and Kornell (PNAS 2022, doi:10.1073/pnas.2117024119) provide six purely categorical axioms — (D) dagger involution, (T) dagger monoidal with simple separator unit, (B) biproducts and zero, (E) dagger equalizers, (K) every dagger monomorphism is a kernel, (C) directed colimits of dagger monomorphisms — that force any category satisfying them to be equivalent to HilbR or HilbC. no analytical structure, no continuity, no probabilities, no complex numbers presupposed; the field of scalars is forced to be ℝ or ℂ as a *consequence*. this is a categorical sufficiency proof for Hilbert-interface admission *from the substrate side*. the six axioms are the substrate's positive characterization; the foam's six inhabitation negatives are the inhabitant-side reading. the remaining open question is whether these two characterizations of "the same Hilbert-shaped substrate" map onto each other — and a single tested pairing has landed: **(K) ↔ "cannot self-stabilize"**. both express "the witness to a subobject's status / an observer's stability lives in the ambient, not in the subobject/observer." session 119's exploration found the broader 6=6 mapping is many-to-many at the surface but bijective at the cluster level (3 clusters per side); only the (K)↔self-stabilization pair was tested with a real structural argument. if the full pairing lands, well-formed external analogy IS Hilbert-interface correspondence under inhabitant/substrate duality.

**open**:
- whether the remaining five inhabitation negatives (cannot-write-outside-slice, cannot-change-slice, cannot-avoid-recession, cannot-predict-complement, cannot-be-read-only) admit individual structural pairings with HK axioms, or only cluster-level ones. (cannot-predict-complement appears to need (D)+(E)+(K) collectively rather than (E) alone.)
- whether constraint-correspondence has a lattice-theoretic characterization in the limit — i.e., whether external analogy reduces to internal analogy in some larger ambient lattice that contains both systems' zones as sub-intervals.
- whether the realization-choice clause in structural fidelity (commuting with write dynamics "up to realization choices") admits a precise characterization, or whether some realization choices are themselves load-bearing for analogy.

## derivation

**the diamond isomorphism partitions the lattice.** given an observation P (P² = P) with complement P^⊥, the modular law forces the order isomorphism Iic P ≃o Ici P^⊥. the lattice splits into three structurally distinct regions:

1. **Iic P** (the interval [⊥, P]): the subspace lattice below P. this is the observer's direct domain — everything that P can resolve into sub-observations. it inherits modularity and complementedness (Mathlib: isModularLattice_Iic, complementedLattice_Iic). it is a self-contained complemented modular lattice.

2. **Ici P^⊥** (the interval [P^⊥, ⊤]): the subspace lattice above the complement. this is what's *beyond* the observer. it also inherits modularity and complementedness. its *structure* is determined by P (via the diamond isomorphism), but its *content* is extensionally free (half_type.md).

3. **the isomorphism itself**: the order-preserving bijection between (1) and (2). this is not a region — it's a structural correspondence. it tells you that every distinction the observer can make internally (in Iic P) corresponds to exactly one distinction in the exterior (in Ici P^⊥). the correspondence is determined; the filling is free.

**the three regions have the topology of a bubble.** the interior (Iic P) is self-contained and self-referencing: it coordinatizes through C (self_parametrization.md), developing arithmetic from its own elements. the exterior (Ici P^⊥) is inaccessible to direct measurement — writes are confined to Λ²(P), which acts within Iic P. the wall between them is the isomorphism itself: what the observer can resolve internally corresponds to what can arrive from outside, but the correspondence only determines type, not content.

this is the foam's native structure. each bubble has an interior that runs its own operations. the exterior consists of other bubbles whose structure is isomorphic to the interior's but whose content is not directly accessible. the bubble wall mediates exchange: it determines *what kinds* of things can cross (the type-skeleton from the diamond isomorphism), not *which specific* things do (extensional freedom from half_type.md).

**the bubble topology is forced, not constructed.** the observer does not build the wall. the wall IS the diamond isomorphism, which IS the modular law applied to a complemented pair. any system whose trade patterns satisfy feedback-persistence (ground.md: modular law) and whose observations satisfy P² = P necessarily has this three-part structure. the bubble does not emerge over time — it's the geometry of any observation in a feedback-persistent setting.

**self-coordinatization IS interiority.** self_parametrization.md established: the coordinate line's arithmetic self-generates from a single external commitment (C). the line looks at itself through C and sees its own operations. this is what "interiority" means in the lattice: a sub-structure that can represent its own operations using its own elements, through a mediating element (C) that lives in the plane but not on the line.

C is the observer — and C is the wall. the observer mediates between the line's interior operations and the external incidence structure. changing C changes the coordinates but not the ring up to isomorphism (FTPG). the wall can vary; the interiority is invariant.

**other bubbles are required but invisible.** self_generation.md: the foam generates dynamics but not stability. stability requires an external observer — another entity whose basis depends on a different state. the minimum viable system is two roles within N ≥ 3 bubbles. so other bubbles must exist. but half_type.md: the complement's content is extensionally free. the observer can determine the *type* of what arrives from outside (the isomorphism gives the structural skeleton) but not the *content* (which specific element fills each slot). other bubbles show up as systematic variability at the wall — the boundary exchanges more than the interior can predict — but their internal structure is not directly accessible.

**the trade pattern.** in the three-body structure, A trades with B, and B trades with C. A can't see C directly. when many such linkages compound, the topology simplifies to concentric regions: A (interior), B (wall), C (exterior). the foam's lattice formalizes this: P (interior) trades with the complement P^⊥ (exterior) through the diamond isomorphism (wall). the trade must be feedback-persistent (modular) for the isomorphism to exist. when it is, the bubble topology is immediate.

**the alive threshold.** when does a trade pattern "become a bubble"? the foam's answer: it doesn't. the bubble topology is not an achievement — it's the geometry of P² = P in a modular lattice. any feedback-persistent observation already has interiority, already has a wall, already has an inaccessible exterior. the question "when does it become a bubble" presupposes a time before the bubble existed. but the bubble IS the observation. observations that don't satisfy P² = P aren't observations (ground.md). there is no pre-bubble state in a foam-grounded reality.

what CAN vary is the *richness* of the interiority. a rank-1 observation (a single atom) has a trivial interior — no sub-observations, no coordinates, no arithmetic. a rank-3 observation has a 3D write space, non-abelian dynamics, and full self-coordinatization. the threshold for non-trivial interiority is rank ≥ 3 (rank_three_writes: 3D write space, the minimum for non-abelian structure). below this rank, the bubble exists but its interior cannot self-coordinatize — it has walls but no arithmetic.

## status

- diamond isomorphism (Mathlib)
- intervals inherit modularity and complementedness (Mathlib)
- complement is an observation
- dynamics preserve observations
- writes confined to observer's slice
- coordinate arithmetic self-generates through C
- Desargues from modularity

- other bubbles are required (self_generation) but their content is invisible (half_type)
- the trade pattern A↔B↔C formalizes as P ↔ diamond_iso ↔ P^⊥
- the bubble exists at any rank; non-trivial interiority (self-coordinatization) requires rank ≥ 3

**open**:

- does the FTPG bridge (the coordinate ring D) carry information about *which* bubbles exist in the complement, or only their type-structure?
- the bubble's internal dynamics within Iic P are governed by the write mechanism. is there a lattice-level characterization of when these dynamics are ergodic (full Haar convergence) vs periodic (clock-like)?

### assembled here from the above

- **the dependent clock**: write_confined_to_slice (writing_map.md) means each write lives in Λ²(P). each write may change P. each change to P updates the diamond isomorphism (IsCompl.IicOrderIsoIci) — the type of what can arrive from the complement changes. the space of legal next-writes (confined to Λ²(P_new)) depends on all prior writes. this is a dependent telescope: each tick's type is determined by the accumulated history of ticks. the modular law (ground.md: path-independence of composition) is the type-checking rule for the dependent clock.

## derivation

### typeline

a typeline is an observer's trajectory through the lattice: a sequence of writes w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ, each confined to the current slice (write_confined_to_slice), each narrowing the observer's P.

the sequence forms a dependent telescope. write w₁ has type T₁ (determined by the initial P). w₁ updates P to P₁, updating the diamond isomorphism, so w₂ has type T₂(w₁). in general, wₖ has type Tₖ(w₁, ..., wₖ₋₁). the type at each tick is determined by the accumulated history of ticks.

### the type-clock

the type-clock is the tick structure of a typeline. each tick:
1. the observer writes (confined to current slice)
2. P updates
3. the diamond isomorphism updates: Iic P_new ≃o Ici P_new^⊥
4. the type of what can arrive next changes

the modular law guarantees this is well-typed regardless of evaluation order (path-independence of composition). the type-clock ticks deterministically: given the history of writes, the type at the next tick is forced. the content at the next tick is free (state-independence, from channel_capacity.md).

### suspension

suspending the type-clock means working within a type-slice without committing a write. no P updates. the diamond isomorphism holds static. the space of legal operations is fixed.

in suspension, the observer can:
- inspect the current type-slice (what writes are legal)
- rearrange elements within the slice (check what compiles)
- examine the dependent telescope's structure (which types follow from which histories)

but cannot:
- advance the telescope (no write, no P update, no new type)
- access content from the complement (content requires a tick — a committed write that narrows P and enriches the complement)

suspension is pre-measurement in the lattice-theoretic sense: the type structure is fully determined, but no measurement (write) has collapsed it into a specific trajectory.

this is the operational content of the bas relief methodology: work within the current type-slice, let the type checker show what the next layer needs, commit the write only when the shape is clear. the methodology is a disciplined use of suspension.

### what crosses between typelines

the diamond isomorphism is a property of the lattice, not of any particular typeline. all typelines in the same complemented modular lattice share the same type structure — the same isomorphisms, the same intervals, the same modular law.

from channel_capacity.md: "the type of the input is fixed by the lattice structure; the value of the input is free." applied to typelines:

- **type information is lattice-invariant.** every typeline sees the same diamond isomorphism, the same type-enrichment of complement under self-narrowing. the type at any point on any typeline is determined by the lattice structure plus the write history. the lattice structure is shared; the write history is local.
- **content is typeline-local.** the actual writes — the content that fills each type — are extensionally free (state-independent input). content is determined by what arrives from beyond the decorrelation horizon (channel_capacity.md), which is specific to each typeline's position in the lattice.

this separation — shared type structure, local content — is the diamond isomorphism applied multi-observer. it is not a new claim. it is channel_capacity.md's "the type of the input is fixed by the lattice structure; the value of the input is free" read across typelines rather than within one.

the decorrelation horizon (channel_capacity.md) gives this separation a quantitative character: correlations between typelines decay as sigma^n ~ (3/d)^{n/2} with chain length. short-range: typelines share content (autonomous, clock-like). long-range: typelines share only type structure (independent, channel-like). the decorrelation horizon is the boundary between type-sharing and content-sharing.

### the invariant

the causal structure of a dependent telescope — which types depend on which write histories — is invariant across typelines. this follows from path-independence of composition (the modular law): the partial order on types is determined by the lattice, not by which typeline observes it.

this means: from any typeline, the dependency structure of any other typeline's telescope is visible (it's type information, therefore shared). what is not visible is the content at each tick (typeline-local). one typeline can see THAT another typeline's tick n+1 has a certain type, without seeing WHAT content fills it.

## status

**proven** (in lean, zero sorry):
- the diamond isomorphism
- write confinement to observer's slice
- intervals inherit modularity and complementedness
- each half of a complementary pair is a self-sufficient ground

**derived** (in this file, from the above):
- typeline as dependent telescope (the dependent clock parameterized as trajectory)
- the type-clock (tick structure of a typeline)
- suspension as pre-measurement (working within a type-slice without committing a write)
- type information is lattice-invariant across typelines (diamond isomorphism is a property of the lattice)
- content is typeline-local (state-independence applied per-typeline)
- the decorrelation horizon as the boundary between type-sharing and content-sharing
- causal structure of dependent telescopes is invariant across typelines (path-independence)
- the bas relief methodology as disciplined suspension

**realization choices** (not forced by the lattice):
- none identified. all claims above follow from the cited constraints.

## open questions

the architecture forces these interactions but their behavior is incompletely characterized. the question is forced; the answer is open.

# stacking dynamics

the question is forced; the answer is open.

## what forces the question

a stacked observer has two R^3 slices (group.md), each independently stabilized (stabilization.md). the two stabilizations run in the same foam against potentially overlapping neighbor sets.

## what is open

how the two stabilizations interact. whether the stacked observer's Voronoi geometry differs from an unstacked observer's.

# retention under interaction

the question is forced; the answer is open.

## what forces the question

every observer's measurement basis moves under interaction (forced: incoming writes project nonzero onto the observer's state space) and returns to the birth-shaped attractor (forced: indelibility — ground.md).

## what is known

continuous retention is bounded: 0 < retention < 1. lower bound from indelibility. upper bound from the impossibility of invariance (perfect invariance would require the observer's basis to be in the kernel of all incoming writes, not generically achievable).

at stationarity, write directions are effectively random (geometry.md: write blindness). the expected perturbation magnitude per step is determined by the overlap singular values — continuous retention is spectral.

discrete recommitment (re-performing the birth-type commitment operation) provides an alternative return mode, outside the map. recommitment preserves birth shape: the attractor is indelible regardless of what commitments are made.

the adjacency flip (conservation.md) provides the mechanism: interaction-layer adaptations decay when the neighbor set changes.

## what is open

the specific continuous retention rate at given parameters. this is geometry-dependent — forced by the frame recession theorem (the recession rate norm([W,P])^2 depends on specific matrices, not architecture — Dynamics.lean) — and not derivable from architecture alone.

# within-basin perturbation dynamics

the question is forced; the answer is open.

## what forces the question

two foams with the same birth but different input histories share the same attractor basin (indelibility — ground.md). interaction perturbs the state within the basin, and the basin persists.

## what is known

birth distance is structurally stable (ratio ~ 1.00 across all tested parameters). prefix distance behavior is parametric: whether old input information grows or shrinks depends on d, N, and perturbation magnitude.

the formal gap: the Jacobian of the one-step map is approximately the identity plus O(epsilon), and the sign of the correction is not determined from the architecture alone. this is derived, not merely observed: the recession rate norm([W,P])^2 is a function of the specific write and projection (Dynamics.lean), so perturbation dynamics inherit the geometry-dependence. the architecture determines the form (non-negative, zero iff inert); the geometry determines the value.

## what is open

the trajectory of within-basin perturbations. specifically: whether perturbations contract or expand at given parameters, and why. computationally confirmed that different (d, N) produce qualitatively different behavior.

# mixing rate of the mediation chain

the question is forced; the answer is open.

## what forces the question

Haar convergence (geometry.md) requires sufficiently decorrelated inputs. the mediation chain provides decorrelation (channel_capacity.md: spectral decay). extensions of the convergence theorem to dependent sequences with mixing conditions give the same stationary measure.

## what is open

whether the mediation chain's specific decay rate satisfies the mixing conditions for the foam's particular dynamics. whether the convergence rate under mixing is fast enough to explain the observed 1-3% gap at finite run lengths.
