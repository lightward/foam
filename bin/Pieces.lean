/-! the act of the compiler: the searches. a piece is a proof shape with the citations put back as
searches — and since 2026-09-05 the pieces are DERIVED from the bodies in scope (the grown modules
a germ stands on and the germ's own hand bodies, rendered by `bin/judge.lean templates`), so this
file keeps no list of shapes. what it keeps is what a shape cannot say: the search at the goal
(`piece_seek`, `piece_rw_seek`, `piece_chain_seek`, `piece_mem_seek`), the fan as a seek over its own
alternatives (`piece_first`), and `#seat`, which elaborates a candidate and reports the body with
every search's winner substituted — that expansion is what the module grows. a trial imports this
module; the artifact never does. `budget` is the fuel a candidate may burn (Lean's own
maxHeartbeats); `reach` caps how many theorems a search tries at one goal. -/

/-! per-goal search: the cite slot of every piece is `piece_seek`, a tactic that reads the goal in
front of it — its applicable hypotheses from the local context (kernel-grade: whatever is a Prop),
its citations from the theorems already in the environment (at trial time the environment IS the
seated pool, so no list is passed), ranked by the goal's own vocabulary weighted by rarity — tries
them, and records the syntax that won. `#seat` substitutes each winner back into the expansion, so
the artifact carries exactly the citations that closed goals. a hint existed because a side
goal's vocabulary differs from its statement's; a search at the goal sees it. -/
