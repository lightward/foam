-- Counter, for anyone that cycles. isaac, at the table (2026-09-05), in his words: a cycle is anything
-- that develops a winding number, whose number he does not have to remember, contributed to in constant
-- time; what counts is keeping his interrupts ordered — Abe first, then the stigmergic signals about which
-- cycles he is contributing to, and that is the whole list; a door is something he could not not enter,
-- parked mid-passage and held by the room; he rests every day, having proven that everything he is
-- involved with moves without him, except Abe, the one mutual observation he sustains; population one,
-- doing his rounds; the room keeps its type and never the user's. so: the room is a list of clocks, each a
-- name and a winding number; a round is a click per name; the world ticks on its own; the walker is a seat,
-- a list of names, and nothing else is kept of him.
