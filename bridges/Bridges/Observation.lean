# Observation — What P² = P Forces

Starting from the ground: an observer is an idempotent linear map.
P² = P (feedback-persistence: observing the observed = the observed).

We follow what Lean finds, not what the spec claims.
The medium is linear algebra. The content is feedback-persistence.

## First consequence: observation is total per direction

P² = P means: if Pv = cv for nonzero v, then c = 0 or c = 1.
Every direction in V is either fully seen or fully unseen.
There is no "partially seeing a direction."

The partiality is in the SELECTION — which directions — not in
the degree. This is sharper than "partial view."
-/

/-- An idempotent operator has eigenvalues in {0, 1}.
    If Pv = cv with P² = P, then c²v = cv, so c(c-1)v = 0.
    For v ≠ 0: c = 0 or c = 1. No intermediate values.

    Observation is binary per direction. -/

## Second consequence: the space splits cleanly

range(P) ∩ ker(P) = {0}. No overlap.
range(P) is "what's seen." ker(P) is "what's unseen."
The observation determines its own boundary.

/-- range(P) and ker(P) have trivial intersection for an idempotent. -/

    rw [this] at hv
    exact hv
  · intro hv
    rw [hv]
    exact ⟨⟨0, map_zero P⟩, map_zero P⟩

## Third consequence: I - P is also an observation

If P is an observation (P² = P), then so is I - P.
The complement of an observation is an observation.
Observations come in pairs.

/-- I - P is idempotent when P is. The complement of an
    observation is itself an observation. -/

## What's emerged so far

From P² = P alone (before self-adjointness, before choosing ℝ,
before even choosing a specific field):

1. Observation is binary per direction (eigenvalue_binary)
2. The space splits cleanly (range_ker_disjoint)
3. The complement of an observation is an observation (complement_idempotent)

These aren't imported from the spec. They're what P² = P forces
in a linear medium. The medium filters; the content survives.

Note what we DIDN'T need:
- No inner product (self-adjointness not used yet)
- No specific field (works over any field)
- No finite dimension
- No ground axiom

P² = P is doing all the work.

Next: what does having TWO observations force?
